What is JavaScript
------------------
- It is a dynamic, weakly type programming language
    - Compiled at runtime
    - Executed as part of a web page in a browser
    - Executed directly on any machine (host environment)


- Originally created to make web pages more dynamic
    - Changes the content of a web page directly from inside a browser


- Initially named "LiveScript", later changed to "JavaScript"
    - Due to the popularity of the Java programming language

    - JavaScript is independent from Java
        - It has nothing in common with the language
        - Besides the similarities of their names


- How do web pages work
    - When a user (i.e. client) visits a web site
        - Hosted on a remote server using a browser

    - The browser initially makes a HTTP request to the server
        - For the corresponding data (e.g. HTML document)

    - The server responds with
        - The requested data if it exists
        - The corresponding error message if the data is non-existent

    - JavaScript
        - Helps the received HTML document to be more reactive

        - Able to change its content
            - Without the need to send another HTTP request to the server
            - To make the change of content possible
