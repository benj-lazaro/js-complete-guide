What is JavaScript
------------------
- It is a dynamic, weakly-type programming language
    - Compited at run-time
    - Executed as part of a web page in a browser
    - Executed directly on any machine (i.e. host environment)


- It was created to make web pages more dynamic
    - Changing content on a page from inside the browser


- Originally named LiveScript
    - Later renamed to JavaScript due to the popularity of Java 
    - JavaScript is TOTALLY INDEPENDENT from Java
        - It has NOTHING in common with the Java programming language
