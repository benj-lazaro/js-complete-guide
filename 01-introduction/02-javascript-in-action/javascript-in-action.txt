JavaScript In Action
--------------------
- Demonstrates an example of dynamic web pages using JavaScript
    - Attached is the starter file (getting-started-01-first-app.zip)

    - It contains two (2) folders and one (1) HTML document
        - "assets" folder
        - "info" folder
        - index.html

    - Open the file "index.html" on the browser


- Use JavaScript on the starter files
    - To dynamically add new content to the HTML document (index.html)
        - Without loading a separate HTML document to render it

        - When specific links w/in the HTML document is clicked
            - New content is rendered as an overlay (modal)

        - This offers a better User Experience (UX)


- To link JavaScript to the HTML document
    - Open the file "index.html" on preferred code editor (e.g. VS Code)

    - Before the closing tag of the HTML element <head>
        - Add the HTML element <script>

        - Add the HTML attribute "src"
            - Link the JavaScript file "app.js"
            - Located w/in "assets/src/"

        - Add the HTML attribute "defer"

            <script src="assets/scripts/app.js" defer></script>

        - Save the changes


- To display the content of the following links as an overlay
    - "info/dynamic.html"
    - "info/weakly-typed.html"

    - Refactor the value of the HTML attribute "href" of the respective HTML element <a>
        - Replace their respective relative paths "info/*.html" with the value of "#"
            
    - Add a new HTML attribute "data-text" to the respective HTML element <a>
        - Open the respective HTML documents on a separate editor window
        - Copy the content of their HTML element <p>
        - Switch back to the file "index.html"
        - Paste the content as value to the HTML attribute "data-text"

    - Add another new HTML attribute "class"
        - Assign with the value of "info-modal"

            <a
                href="#"
                data-text="That means that code is not pre-compiled but instead evaluated, compiled
                and executed at runtime (e.g. when the browser executes the script)."
                class="info-modal">dynamic, interpreted
            </a>

            <a
                href="#"
                data-text="Weakly typed languages assign types (like 'number') to variables (data
                containers) at runtime - i.e. you (the developer) can't set the types
                you want to use in certain places in advance. Only indirectly by making
                sure you're always working with the correct values."
                class="info-modal">weakly typed
            </a>

    - Save the changes


- What happens in the background
    - When the file "index.html" is loaded in the browser

    - JavaScript scans the HTML document
        - For elements With the HTML attribute "class" whose value is "info-modal"
        - These are the HTML element <a>

    - JavaScript waits for a "click" event
        - This is when one of the HTML element <a> is clicked

    - When one of the HTML element <a> 
        - JavaScript loads either of the two Functions
            - presentInfoModal()
            - hideInfoModal()

        - Renders (or hides) the new content as an overlay, respectively
