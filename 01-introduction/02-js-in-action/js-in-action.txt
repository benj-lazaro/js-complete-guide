JavaScript In Action
--------------------
- The attached project demonstrates JavaScript in action 
    - Demonstrates a normal webpage


- Refactor the index.html
    - To demonstrate how JavaScript provide a level of user-interaction 

    - Link-up the provided app.js to the webpage
        - The script file is located at assests/scripts/app.js

        - Add a <script> tag beneath the last <link> tag
            - Within the <head> section
            
        <script src="assets/scripts/app.js" defer></script>


    - Within the content of the webpage
        - Refactor the following hyperlinks:
      
        <a href="info/dynamic.html">dynamic, interpreted</a>

        <a href="info/weakly-typed.html">weakly typed</a>


        - Into their respective updates:

        <a
            href="#"
            data-text="That means that code is not pre-compiled but instead evaluated, compiled
            and executed at runtime (e.g. when the browser executes the script)."
            class="info-modal">dynamic, interpreted
        </a>

        <a
            href="#"
            data-text="Weakly typed languages assign types (like 'number') to variables (data
            containers) at runtime - i.e. you (the developer) can't set the types
            you want to use in certain places in advance. Only indirectly by making
            sure you're always working with the correct values."
            class="info-modal">weakly typed
        </a>


    - These changes implements an dynamic overlay 
        - Displayed when the following hyperlinks are clicked

        - Content taken from the respective html files
            - info/dynamic.html
            - info/weakly-typed.html

        - Imported as value to the HTML attribute data-text

        - The overlay behavior defined in app.js is linked through the HTML attribute class
            - Assigned with the value "info-modal"
