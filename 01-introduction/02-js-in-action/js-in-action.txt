JavaScript In Action
--------------------
- Attached starter files
    - Demonstrates JavaScript in action


- Open the file "index.html"
    - At the closing tag of the HTML element <head>
        - Add the HTML element <script>

    - Add the HTML attribute "src"
        - Assign the relative path (string) of the JavaScript file "app.js"

    - After the relative path
        - Add a whitespace
        - Followed by adding the HTML attribute "defer"

            <script src="assets/scripts/app.js" defer></script>

        - Save the changes


- Refactor the content of "index.html"
    - Add a couple of "dynamic overlays"
        - Replacing links of the following external HTML documents
            - dynamic.html
            - weakly-typed.html
    

- Refactor the HTML document "index.html"
    - To implement a couple of "Dynamic Overlays"
        - Effectively replacing the links to the following external HTML documents
            - dynamic.html
            - weakly-typed.html

    - Refactor the following HTML <a> tags
        - From:

            <a href="info/dynamic.html">dynamic, interpreted</a>

            <a href="info/weakly-typed.html">weakly typed</a>

        - To:

            <a
                href="#"
                data-text="That means that code is not pre-compiled but instead evaluated, compiled
                and executed at runtime (e.g. when the browser executes the script)."
                class="info-modal">dynamic, interpreted
            </a>

            <a
                href="#"
                data-text="Weakly typed languages assign types (like 'number') to variables (data
                containers) at runtime - i.e. you (the developer) can't set the types
                you want to use in certain places in advance. Only indirectly by making
                sure you're always working with the correct values."
                class="info-modal">weakly typed
            </a>

    - When either of the HTML <a> tags is clicked
        - It launches an "info-modal"

        - Loads and renders the associated content to the browser
            - Taken from the corresponding HTML attribute "data-text"
