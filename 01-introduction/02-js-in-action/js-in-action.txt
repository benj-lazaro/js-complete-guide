JavaScript In Action
--------------------
- The attached project demonstrates JavaScript in action


- Open the file "index.html"
    - Within the HTML element <head>
        - Just beneath the last HTML element <link>
        - Add the HTML element <script> </script>

    - Link the JavaScript file "app.js" to the HTML document "index.html"
        - At the opening <script> tag
            - Add the HTML attribute "src"
            - Assign "app.js" file's relative path as value

        - Next, add the HTML attribute "defer"
            
            <script src="assets/scripts/app.js" defer></script>

        - Save changes


- Refactor the HTML document "index.html"
    - To implement a couple of "Dynamic Overlays"
        - Effectively replacing the links to the following external HTML documents
            - dynamic.html
            - weakly-typed.html

    - Refactor the following HTML <a> tags
        - From:

            <a href="info/dynamic.html">dynamic, interpreted</a>

            <a href="info/weakly-typed.html">weakly typed</a>

        - To:

            <a
                href="#"
                data-text="That means that code is not pre-compiled but instead evaluated, compiled
                and executed at runtime (e.g. when the browser executes the script)."
                class="info-modal">dynamic, interpreted
            </a>

            <a
                href="#"
                data-text="Weakly typed languages assign types (like 'number') to variables (data
                containers) at runtime - i.e. you (the developer) can't set the types
                you want to use in certain places in advance. Only indirectly by making
                sure you're always working with the correct values."
                class="info-modal">weakly typed
            </a>

    - When either of the HTML <a> tags is clicked
        - It launches an "info-modal"

        - Loads and renders the associated content to the browser
            - Taken from the corresponding HTML attribute "data-text"
