How JavaScript Is Executed
--------------------------
- JavaScript code is executed
    - Using a JavaScript Engine built into the browser
    - The same applies to any environment capable of running JavaScript code


- Popular web browsers have their own JavaScript Engine:
    - Chrome, Edge, Opera   = V8
    - FireFox               = SpiderMonkey


- JavaScript Engine's job is to:
    - Parse (read & undertstand) the JavaScript code
    - Compile each line "on-the-fly" into its corresponding Machine code
    - Optimize & executes the Machine code on a single thread

    - NOTE: Each browser JavaScript Engine has their own optimizations
        - How it parses & executes JavaScript code
