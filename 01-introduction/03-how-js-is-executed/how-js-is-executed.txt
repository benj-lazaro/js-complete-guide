How JavaScript Is Executed
--------------------------
- The JavaScript Engine is the most important piece of code
    - When executing JavaScript code in the browser
    - Googe Chrome  = V8
    - FireFox       = SpiderMonkey


- The JavaScript Engine's job is as follows:
    - Parse the JavaScript code
    - Compile the code on-the-fly into Machine code
    - Execute the Machine code on a single thread
