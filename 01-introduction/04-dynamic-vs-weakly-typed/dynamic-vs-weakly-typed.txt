Dynamic VS Weakly Typed Languages
---------------------------------
- Dynamic (i.e. interpreted) programming language
    - Code is NOT pre-compiled
        - It is parsed first
        - Then compiled "on-the-fly" (in the browser) as it executes at runtime

    - Code can change at runtime
        - A variable's data type can be changed at runtime
        - e.g. string type switches to integer type at a later time


- Weakly Typed programming language
    - A variable's data type is IMPLICITLY assumed

    - It does NOT require to declare the data type of a value
        - In advance before being assigned to a variable

    - The data type of a variable's assigned value is NOT set in stone
        - It can be changed at runtime
