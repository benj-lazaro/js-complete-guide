Dynamic VS Weakly Typed Languages
---------------------------------
- Dynamic (interpreted) programming language
    - NOT pre-compiled
        - Code is parsed first
        - Then compiled on-the-fly in the browser during runtime

    - Code is evaluated and then executed at runtime

    - Code can change at runtime
        - A variable's data type can be changed during runtime
            - e.g. A string value can be replaced with an integer at a later time


- Weakly typed programming language
    - Data type of a variable's value is automatically or implicitly assumed

    - It does NOT require stating the data type of the value
        - To be stored in a variable in advance

    - Data type of a variable's value is NOT set in stone
        - Can be changed at runtime
