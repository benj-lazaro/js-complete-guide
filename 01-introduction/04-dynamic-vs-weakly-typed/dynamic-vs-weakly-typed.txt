Dynamic VS Weakly Typed Languages
---------------------------------
- Dynamic, interpreted Programming Language 
    - Not pre-compiled
        - Parsed and then compiled (on-the-fly) in the browser during runtime

    - Code is evaluated & then executed at runtime

    - Code can change at runtime
        - A variable's assigned data type can be changed during runtime
        - e.g. initially assigned string data type later replaced with an integer data type


- Weakly Typed Programming Language
    - Data type of a value assigned to variable is automatically / implicitly assumed

    - Does NOT require defining the data type of the value to be stored in a variable in advance 

    - Data type of value assigned in a variable is NOT set in stone 
        - It can be changed during runtime
