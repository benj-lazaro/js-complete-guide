Dynamic VS Weakly Typed Languages
---------------------------------
- JavaScript is a dynamic, intepreted & weakly-typed programming language


- Dynamic
    - A value stored in a variable can dynamically change at runtime
        - e.g. A string value later changed to a number

    - NOTE: A "variable" is simply a temporal data container


- Interpreted
    - JavaScript code is NOT pre-compiled

    - The code is evaluated (parsed), compiled into Machine code "on-the-fly"
        - Then executed at runtime
    

- Weakly typed
    - The data type of a value stored in a JavaScript variable
        - Can change at runtime
        - Data type is NOT "set in stone"

    - JavaScript IMPLICITLY assumes (infers) the data type
        - Solely on the value assigned in a variable

        - Does NOT require to declare the data type in advance
            - Prior to its assignment to a variable

            - It simply does NOT care about strong declarations in advance
