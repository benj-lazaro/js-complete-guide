JavaScript VS Java 
------------------
- JavaScript
    - It is a flexible, weakly-typed programming language
        - Runs in the browser
        - Inspired to be named after Java to 'sound cool'

    - JavaScript client-side
        - Runs in the browser
        - Original JavaScript implementation
        - Interacts with the web page and browser's API
        - Browser vendors provide their own JavaScript Engine 

    - JavaScript server-side
        - Runs on a host machine connected to the Internet
        - Does NOT run directly on user's machine (like the client-side)
        - Access special non-browser APIs
        - Extracts the JavaScript Engine in order to run JavaScript anywhere

    - NOTE: The syntax & principles of the JavaScript client-side & server-side are the same


- Java is an object-oriented, strongly-type programming language
    - NOT supported to run directly from the browser


- NOTE: JavaScript and Java are independent programming languages
    - Each has its own syntax and principles
