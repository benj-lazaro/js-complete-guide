JavaScript VS Java 
------------------
- JavaScript is a flexible, weakly-type programming language
    - Was inspired to be named after Java to "sound cool"
    - It runs in the browser

    - JavaScript Client-side
        - Runs in the brwoser
        - Original JavaScript implementation 
        - Browser vendors provide their own JavaScript Engines
        - Interacts with the web page & browser API

    - JavaScript Server-side
        - Runs on a machine connected to the Internet
        - Does NOT run on the directly on the machine of the users (client-side)
        - Extracts the JavaScript Engine to run JavaScript anywhere
        - Access special non-browser APIs 

    - The syntax & principles of both client-side and server-side are the same
    

- Java is an object-oriented, strongly-type programming language
    - NOT supported to run directly from the browser


- Both are totally independent languages with different syntax & principles
