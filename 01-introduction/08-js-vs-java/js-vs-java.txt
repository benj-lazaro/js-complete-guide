JavaScript VS Java 
------------------
- Comparison between JavaScript & Java
    - Both are totally independent programming languages
    - Each has their own different syntax & principles
    - Have nothing in common besides their names


- JavaScript
    - A flexible, weakly-typed programming language
        - That runs w/in the browser as well as on the server side

    - JavaScript client side (browser)
        - Origin of JavaScript

        - Browser vendors provide their own JavaScript Engine

        - Allows interaction with web pages & browser-specific APIs

    - JavaScript server side
        - Runs JavaScript outside of the browser & anywhere using Node.js
        
        - Allows for code & knowledge reuse
        
        - Allows access to non-brwoser APIs
            - e.g. local filesystem, incoming HTTP requests, etc.

    - NOTE: Syntax, concepts & core features of the client & server side are EXACTLY the SAME


- Java
    - A strictly object-oriented and strongly typed programming language
        - It is NOT supported to run directly w/in the browser
