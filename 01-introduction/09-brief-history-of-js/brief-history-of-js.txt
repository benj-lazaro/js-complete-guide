A Brief History Of JavaScript
-----------------------------
- JavaScript's brief history outline
    - 1995
        - Netscape introduces LiveScript
        - Later renamed JavaScript

    - 1996
        - Microsoft released their own version of JavaScript
            - For their Internet Explorer browser
        
        - Same idea and (generally) same syntax
            - But implemented differently 

    - 1996 (late)
        - JavaScript submitted to ECMA International
            - To start standardization
            - To address the fragmented implementation of JavaScript
            
            - NOTE: ECMA (European Computer Manufacturers Association)

    - 1997 to 2005
        - Standardization effort continues

        - Microsoft did NOT joined & supported the standardized JavaScript version

    - 2008 to 2011
        - Huge progress with JavaScript's ecosystem that resulted into
            - A uniform language with minor differences
            
        - Single core language that can be implemented on different browsers
            - Each browser can have their own specific feature(s)

        - Microsoft joined & became part of the standardization process
            - Contributed in building the standardized JavaScript & add new features


- ECMAScript
    - Refers to the actual language that was evolved by the ECMA International Organization
        - It is NOT directly used as it is (i.e. in this form)

    - Browser vendors
        - Implements the ECMAScript into their JavaScript Engine as JavaScript

        - Select & implement features defined in ECMAScript 
            - That will be supported by their browser

    - Browser vendors implement the standard (i.e. ECMAScript)
        - Into their respective JavaScript Engines as JavaScript

        - Implement features (defined in ECMAScript) that 
            - Will be supported by their browser
