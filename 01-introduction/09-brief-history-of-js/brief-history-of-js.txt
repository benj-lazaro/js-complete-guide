A Brief History Of JavaScript
-----------------------------
- 1995
    - Netscape introduces "LiveScript"
    - Later renamed "JavaScript"


- 1996
    - Microsoft released its own version of Internet Explorer
        - Same idea, generally same syntax
        - But implemented differently


- 1996 (Late)
    - JavaScript submitted to ECMA International to start standardization
        - To address the fragmented implementation of JavaScript

    - ECMA = European Computer Manufacturers Association


- 1997 - 2005
    - Standardication efforts
    - Microsoft DID NOT JOIN & SUPPORT the standardized JavaScript version


- 2008 - 2011
    - Huge progress in JavaScript ecosystem
        - Resulted into a uniform language with minor differences
        - One core language that can be used in different browsers
            - Different browsers have their own specific features

    - Microsoft eventually join forces & became part of the standardization process
        - Contributed in building the standard & adding new features


- ECMAScript
    - Actual language evolved by the ECMA International Organization
    
    - It is NOT directly used as it is
        - Browser Vendors implement the standard into their JavaScript Engines as JavaScript
        
    - Each browser comes with its own JavaScript Engine 
        - Define which features (defined in the ECMAScript) that are actually supported
