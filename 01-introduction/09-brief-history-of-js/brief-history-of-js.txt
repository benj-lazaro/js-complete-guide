A Brief History Of JavaScript
-----------------------------
- JavaScript historical timeline and how it evolved over time
    - 1995
        - Netscape introduces "LiveScript"
        - Later renamed "JavaScript"

    - 1996
        - Microsoft released their own version of JavaScript
            - For their Internet Explorer (IE) browser

        - Same idea & generally same syntax
            - But implemented differently
            - Require to write different scripts for different browsers

        - JavaScript submitted to ECMA International
            - To start standardization
            - To address the fragmented implementation of JavaScript
        
            - NOTE: ECMA (European Computer Manufacturers Association)

    - 1997 to 2005
        - JavaScript standardization effort continues

        - Microsoft did NOT join & support the standardized JavaScript version
            - Eventually supported but have differences with implementation

    - 2008 to 2011
        - Huge progress in JavaScript ecosystem

        - Microsoft eventually joined forces
            - Became part of the standardization process 
            - Contributed to building the standard & adding new features


- ECMA International
    - A standards organization that manages & evolves the "ECMAScript" language

    - ECMAScript is then implemented by browser vendors as JavaScript 
        - JavaScript being the MOST FAMOUS implementation
        - Others include the (now defunct) "ActionScript" and "jscript"

    - JavaScript in the end is ECMAScript
    
    - ECMAScript is NOT directly used
        - Browser vendors implement the ECMAScript standard into their JavaScript Engines
        - JavaScript Engines defines which standard features that are actually supported

    - ECMAScript is under active development
        - Browser vendors are contributing
        - Shaping how JavaScript looks like
        - Basically JavaScript is also under active development
