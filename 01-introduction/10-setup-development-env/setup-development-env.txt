Setting Up A Development Environment
------------------------------------
- A good & proper development environment
    - To write code & dive into JavaScript

    - VS Code is a strongly recommended code editor
        - Customizable & extensible
        - Modern & under active development
        
        - Recommended core extensions:
            - Material Icon Theme (Philipp Keif)
            - Prettier (Esben Petersen)

    - Google Chrome is a strongly recommended browser
        - Offers built-in Developer Tools
        - For testing & seeing JavaScript code in action


- VS Code's User VS Workspace Settings
    - User
        - Implements configuration changes on ALL projects managed by VS Code

    - Workspace
        - Implements configuration changes on a SPECIFIC project


- Google Chrome browser settings
    - Use "Incognito Mode"
        - Disables installed browser plugins that interfere
            - Or caused unforeseen issues with your code

    - On the Developer Tools "Console"
        - Click "Preferences" (gear icon)

        - Under the section "Network"
            - Uncheck the checkbox "Preserve log" (if checked)

        - Ensures that the JavaScript console is empty
            - Every time a web page is loaded (and reloaded)
