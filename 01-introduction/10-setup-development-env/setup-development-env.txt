Setting Up A Development Environment
------------------------------------
- Development environment 
    - Code editor   = VS Code
    - Browser       = Google Chrome + Browser Developer Tools


- Recommended VS Code Plugins
    - Material Icon Theme (Philipp Kief)
    - Prettier (Esben Petersen)


- VS Code User VS Workspace Settings
    - User      = implements config changes on ALL projects managed by VS Code
    - Workspace = implements config changes on a specific project


- Google Chrome Settings
    - Use "Incognito Mode" 
        - To prevent from being distrated by other installed browser plugins
    
    - On the JavaScript Console log
        - Uncheck "Preserve log" 
        - To ensure the console will be emptied at EVERY TIME a web page is reloaded
