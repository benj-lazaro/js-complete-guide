Adding JavaScript To The Website
--------------------------------
- Create a new JavaScript file named "app.js"
    - W/in the folder "assets/scripts"
    - This file will store the logic of the web-based calculator


- On the "index.html"
    - Link the JavaScript file

    - At the closing tag of the HTML element <body>
        - Add the HTML element <script>
            - Declare the HTML attribute "src"
            - Assign the path for the JavaScript file "vendor.js"
        
        - Add another HTML element <script>
            - Declare the HTML attribute "src"
            - Assign the path for the JavaScript file "app.js"

    - NOTE: Declaring the HTML elements <script> at the closing tag of the <body>
        - Allows the browser to render the content of the HTML document
        - BEFORE calling the logic stored in the JavaScript file "app.js"


- To test the connectivity between the HTML document and "app.js"
    - Open the JavaScript file "app.js"

    - Add the line of code

        alert("This works!");

    - Save the changes
