Adding JavaScript To The Website
--------------------------------
- To add your own JavaScript code into the starter project
    - Create a new JavaScript file named "app.js" w/in the folder "assets/scripts"
        - Add the following line of code

            alert("This works!");

        - Save the changes

        - This file will eventually contain the logic for the web-based calculator

    - On the HTML document "index.html"
        - Import the JavaScript files "app.js" & "vendor.js"
    
        - At the closing tag of the HTML element <body>
            - Add the HTML element <script>
                - Declare the HTML attribute "src"
                - Assign the path for the JavaScript file "vendor.js"
        
            - Add another HTML element <script>
                - Declare the HTML attribute "src"
                - Assign the path for the JavaScript file "app.js"

            - NOTE: The "vendor.js" contains dependencies that will be needed by "app.js"

        - Importing the JavaScript files at the end of the HTML document
            - Allows the browser to render the entire content
            - BEFORE the JavaScript files are executed & access the content

        - Save the changes

    - Test the connectivity between the HTML document & the "app.js"
        - Load / reload the "index.html" on the browser
        
        - Content of the HTML document is rendered
            - Then a pop-up window (alert) appears with the content "This works!"
            - Click the button "OK" to close the alert window
