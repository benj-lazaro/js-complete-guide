Introducing Variables & Constants
---------------------------------
- A variable is a data container where the assigned value can change

- To define a variable
    - Use the JavaScript keyword "let"
    - Followed by a name
    - Followed by a = operator
    - Followed by the assigned value

Example:
let userName = "Max";
userName = "Maximillian";


- A constant is a data container where the assigned MUST NOT change
    - Assigning a new value triggers a TypeError

- To define a constant
    - Use the JavaScript keyword "const"
    - Followed by a name
    - Followed by a = operator
    - Followed by the assigned value

    - NOTE: Use constants as often as possible on data that NEVER changes 

Example:
const userName = "Max";
userName = "Maximillian";   // Triggers a TypeError
