Introducing Variables & Constants
---------------------------------
- A variable 
    - A data container where the assigned value can CHANGE during runtime

    - To define a variable
        - JavaScript keyword "let"
        - Followed by a name and the operator "="
        - Then the assigned value
        - Concludes with a ";"
        
    Syntax:

    let <variable_name> = <assigned_value>;
    
    Example:

    let username = "Max";
    username = "Maximillian";  // Overwrite initial assigned value


- A constant
    - A data container where the assigned value MUST NOT CHANGE during runtime
    
    - Assigning a new value triggers a "TypeError"

    - To define a constant
        - JavaScript keyword "const"
        - Followed by a name and the operator "="
        - Then the assigned value
        - Concludes with a ";"
        
    Syntax:

    let <variable_name> = <assigned_value>;
    
    Example:

    const username = "Max";
    username = "Maximillian";  // Triggers a TypeError
