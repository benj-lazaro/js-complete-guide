Introducing Variables & Constants
---------------------------------
- A variable is a data container or storage wherein
    - The assigned value can CHANGE during runtime

    - Once a value is assigned to a variable
        - There is NO need to use the keyword "let" when referring to it


    Syntax:
    let <name> = <value>;

    Example:
    let username = "Max";       // Assigns an initial string value
    username = "Maximillian;    // Overwrites previous string value


- A constant is another data container or storage wherein
    - The assigned value MUST NOT CHANGE during runtime

    - Once a value is assigned to a constant
        - There is NO need to use the keyword "const" when referring to it
    
    - Attempt to re-assign a new value into a constant
        - Triggers a "TypeError"

    - It is used for storing data that NEVER CHANGES


    Syntax:
    const <name> = <value>;

    Example:
    const username = "Max";     // Initial string value
    username = "Maximillian;    // Triggers a "TypeError"


- On the starter project
    - Open the file "app.js"
        - Remove the previous line of code (i.e. alert())
            - Used for testing the connectivity w/ "index.html"

    - This file will contain the logic of
        - Performing mathematical operations between two numbers
