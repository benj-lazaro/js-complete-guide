Declaring & Defining Variables
------------------------------
- To declare a JavaScript variable name
    - Use the camelCase naming convention
        - While snake_case is allowed but it is considered as BAD PRACTICE

    - Contains ONLY letters & numbers
        - NOT allowed to start with a number or special characters
        - NO whitespace in-between words of the name
        - NOTE: JavaScript is case-sensitive 

    - May start w/ the character "$" or "_"
        - NO special characters in-between words of the name

    - NOT allowed to use reserved JavaScript keywords


    Example:
    let userName        // Using camelCase naming convention
    let ageGroup5       // Contains letters and numbers
    let $kindOfSpecial  // Starts with "$"
    let _internalValue  // Starts with "_"

    let user_name       // Using snake_case is BAD PRACTICE
    let 21Players       // NOT allowed to start with a number
    let user-bad        // NOT allowed to contain a special characters
    let let             // NOT allowed to use a JavaScript reserved keyword


- To define a JavaScript variable
    - A variable does NOT REQUIRE to be initial with a value
    - NOTE: Referred as an "uninitialized" variable


    Example:
    let score;          // Uninitialized variable


- On using a ";" at the end of a JavaScript expression
    - This practice is considered OPTIONAL
        - Important thing is to be consistent throughout the entire codebase

    - A ";" is REQUIRED 
        - When writng two (2) expressions on a single line of code


    Example:
    let const a = 1; let const b = 2;
    

- On the starter project
    - Declare a new variable "currentResult"
    - Assign it with an initial value of 0
