Declaring & Defining Variables
------------------------------
- Declaring a JavaScript variable 
    - Use the camelCase naming convention
    - Contains ONLY letters and numbers
    - May start with character "$" or "_"
    - JavaScript is CASE-SENSITIVE
    
    Example:

    let userName        // camelCase naming convention
    let ageGroup5       // contains letters and numbers
    let $kindOfSpecial  // starts with "$"
    let _internalValue  // starts with "_"

    - While using the snake_case naming convention is allowed
        - It is considered as "bad practice"
    
    - NOT allowed to start with a number or special character
    - NOT allowed to use a special character anywhere w/in the variable name
    - NOT allowed to use a JavaScript keyword as variable name

    Example:
    let user_name       // snake_case
    let 21Players       // starts with a number
    let user-bad        // contains a special characters
    let let             // uses a JavaScript keyword "let"


- Defining a JavaScript variable
    - Does NOT require to be initialized with an initial value
    - NOTE: This is referred as an "uninitialized variable"
    

- Using a semi-colon ";" 
    - At the end of a JavaScript expression is generally OPTIONAL
    
    - However, it is REQUIRED when writing two (2) expressions
        - On a single line of code
        - e.g. let const a = 1; let const b = 2;
