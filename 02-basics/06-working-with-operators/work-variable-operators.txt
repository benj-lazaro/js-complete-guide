Working With Variables & Operators
----------------------------------
- An operator is a syntax feature in JavaScript that
    - Allows to manipulate values

    - JavaScript Mathematical operators
        - +     = Addition
        - -     = Subtraction
        - *     = Multiplication
        - /     = Division
        - %     = Modulo
        - **    = Exponentiation

        - NOTE: JavaScript follows normal mathematical rules (PMDAS)

    - The assignment operator "="
        - Assigns a value into a variable


- On the starter project
    - Open the file "assets/scripts/app.js"

    - After the declaration of the variable "currentResult"
        - Write a mathematical expression
        
            (currentResult + 10) * 3 / 2 - 1
         
        - Assign the result of the expression back to "currentResult"
            - Effectively overwriting the initial value of 0

    - Render the new value of "currentResult" on the browser
        - Call the function "outputResult()" defined w/in the file "vendor.js"

        - Pass the variable "currentResult" & an empty string
            - As argument values to the function

    - Save the changes
    
    - Load / reload the HTML document "index.html" on the browser
        - The sum is rendered besides the text "Result: "
