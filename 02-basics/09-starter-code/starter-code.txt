Understanding The Starter Code
------------------------------
- A walkthrough of the starter project's code


- In the file "assets/scripts/app.js"
    - Declares a variable "currentResult"

    - The "currentResult" stores the result of a mathematical expression
        - After it is evaluated

    - Calls the function "outputResult()"
        - Declared w/in the file "assets/scripts/vendor.js"

        - Accepts two argument values
            - 1st = value stored w/in "currentResult"
            - 2nd = an empty string


- On the function "outputResult()"
    - Declared to have two (2) parameters namely "result" & "text"
        - Receives the values passed from "app.js"

    - Assigns the value of "result" (i.e. value from "currentResult")
        - To the text content of the selected HTML element <h2>
            - With an HTML attribute "id" of "current-result"

    - Assigns the value of "text" (i.e. empty string)
        - To the text content of the selected HTML element <h2>
            - With an HTML attribute "id" of "current-calculation"

        - NOTE: Both rendered values are of data type "string"
            - Instead of "number"

    - Browser then renders the values in the HTML document (index.html)
