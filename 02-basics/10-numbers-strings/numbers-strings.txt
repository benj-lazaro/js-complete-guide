Data Types: Numbers & Strings (Text)
------------------------------------
- JavaScript Data Types
    - Number
        - For calculations of integers and/or floats
        - For working with a (positive & negative) numbers
        - e.g. 2, -3, 22.956

    - String
        - For working with text
        - For gathering text user-input & outputing text results
        
        - Expressed by enclosing text w/in a pair of:
            - Single quotes ' '
            - Double quotes " "
            - Backticks ` `

        - e.g. 'Hi', "Hi", `Hi`

    - Boolean
        - For working with conditional statements
        - e.g. true, false

    - Objects
        - For grouping and organizing related data
        - Enclosed w/in a pair of { }
        - e.g. { name: "Max", age: 31}

    - Arrays
        - For listing unknown amount of data
        - Elements enclosed w/in a pair of [ ]
        - e.g. [1, 3, 5]


- On the starter project
    - Open the file "assets/scripts/app.js"

    - Declare a new variable named "calculationDescription"
        - Below the declaration of the variable "currentResult"

        - Assign a stirng value based on the previous line's mathematical expression

    - Use the string concatenation operator "+"
        - To insert the variable "currentResult" w/in the string value

        let calculationDescription = "(" + currentResult + "+ 10) * 3 / 2 - 1";

    - Pass the variable "calculationDescription"
        - As the 2nd argument value to the function "outputResult()"
    
    - Move the line of code where the variable "currentResult" is
        - Assigned with the value of the mathematical expression

        - Below the declaration of the variable "calculationDescription" in order
            - To render the string representation of the mathematical expression properly

    - Save the changes

    - Browser then renders the values in the HTML document (index.html)
