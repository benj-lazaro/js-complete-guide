More On Strings
---------------
- The string data type is expressed using
    - Either a pair of single ' ' or double " " quotes around a string value
        - Important thing is consistency
        - Stick to the chosen convention throughout the entire codebase

    - A pair of backticks ` `
        - Offers a feature known as "template literal"

        - Renders a value stored within a constant, expression or variable
            - As string

        - This is expressed using the syntax:

            ${<constant | expression | variable>}

        - Also offers the ability to render a multiline string
            - A string containing multiple line breaks
            - NOT achievable when enclosing a string with a pair of single or double quotes
            
    - Using a "\" followed by a single character within a string
        - Functions as an "escape character"

        - The character is NOT treated as a normal character
            - Each character has a special meaning (or purpose)

        Example:

        \n  = linebreak
        \'  = single quote
        \\  = backslash
