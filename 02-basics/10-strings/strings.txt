More On Strings
---------------
- Single or double quotes can be used for a string data type
    - Important thing is consistency and to stick to the chosen convention
    - Content in-between the quotes is considered as text


- Backticks (leftside of '1' key) offers a feature known as template literal
    - It renders the value of a constant, variable or expression as text

    - This is done using a special syntax
        - A $ sign followed by a pair of { }
        - Passing the name of constant, variable or expression as an argument value

        ${[constant_name | variable_name | expression]}


- Template literals also offer the ability to write multiline Strings
    - Strings that contain multiple line breaks
    - This is NOT possible with single or double quotes strings


- Using a '\' in a string serves as an escape character
    - Any character AFTER the \ is NOT treated as a normal character
    - It will have a special meaning depending on the chosen character

    Example:
    \n  = linebreak
    \'  = single quote
    \\  = backslash
