Introducting Functions
----------------------
- Function is referred as code on demand
    - It is a language construct
    - It defines a piece of code that can be executed at a later point of time


- The code within a function does NOT immediately get executed
    - When the main JavaScript code is being executed
    - The function code is registered & stored in memory
    - Until it is called from the main JavaScript code


- To define a Function, use the syntax:

    function <name>([parameter, parameter, etc]) {
        // body of code
    }

    - The use of a parameter is optional
    - Returning a value from within a function using the keyword return is also optional


- Calling a function, use the convention

    <function_name>([argument, argument, etc]);
