Using Constants
---------------
- The browser reads the content of a HTML document from top to bottom
    - Renders (executes) each line that is read


- JavaScript's default behavior
    - JavaScript code is parsed (read) from top to bottom
    
    - Each line parsed is
        - Compiled
        - Executed "on-the-fly"


- On the starter project
    - Open the file "assets/scripts/app.js"

    - Declare a new constant named "defaultResult"
        - Assign with the value of 0

    - Copy the value of the constant "defaultResult"
        - To the declaration of the variable "currentResult"
        - Effectively initialzing the variable

    - Assign the result of the mathematical expression
        - Into the variable "currentResult"

    - Declare a new variable named "calculationDescription"
        - Assign the string representation of the previous mathematical expression

    - Pass the variables "currentResult" and "calculationDescription"
        - As argument values to the function "outputResult()"

    - Save the changes

    - Browser then renders the values in the HTML document (index.html)
