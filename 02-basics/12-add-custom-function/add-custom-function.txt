------------------------
- Explores the different between
    - Global-scoped variable
    - Local-scoped variable

    - Declaring a new Function inot the code base of "app.js"


- Global-scoped variables
    - Variable(s) declared outside of a Function
    - Variable(s) that can be referred w/in a Function


- Local-scope variable(s)
    - Variable(s) declared w/in a Function
    - Variable(s) can NOT be referenced OUTSIDE a Function


- The built-in JavaScript Function "alert()"
    - Renders a pop-up message on the browser as the web page is rendered
    - Requires a "string" data type as argument value
