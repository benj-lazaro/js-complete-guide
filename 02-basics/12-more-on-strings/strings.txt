More On Strings
---------------
- As previous mentioned, data type string is expressed w/in a pair of:
    - Single quotes ''
    - Double quotes ""

    - Important: Stick to the chosen convention throughout the entire codebase
        - Avoid mixing the opening & closing quote character
        - Doing so triggers an "Uncaught SyntaxError"


- A pair of backticks `` offers a feature known as "Template Literal"
    - It injects (interpolates) the value of a constant, variable or expression into a string
    
    - Require to enclose the constant, variable or expressed w/in a "${ }"


    Syntax:
        `Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, ${<constant | expression | variable>} consectetur...`


    - It also offers the ability to render a multi-line string
        - A string that contains multiple line breaks
        - NOT achievable when enclosing a string w/in a pair of ' ' or " "


- Escape characters in a string value
    - Expressed using a "\" followed by a single character
        - Enclosed w/in a pair of ' ' or " "

    - These characters are NOT treated as normal characters
        - Each has its own special meaning or purpose

    - Reference (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Lexical_grammar#escape_sequences)
    

    Example:
        \n  = linebreak
        \'  = single quote
        \\  = backslash


- On the starter project
    - Open the file "assets/scripts/app.js"

    - On the variable "calculationDescription"
        - Replace the assigned string with a Template Literal

    - Declare a new variable "errorMessage"
        - Assign a string value embedded with an escape character "\n"

    - Replace the variable "calculationDescription" with "errorMessage"
        - When calling the function "outputResult()"

    - Save the changes

    - Browser then renders the values in the HTML document (index.html)
    
    - Launch Chrome's "Developer Tools"
        - Inspect the HTML element <h2> with an attribute "id" of "current-calculation"

        - Set the CSS Selector "element.style"
            - Set the CSS Property "white-space" to the value of "pre"

        - Renders the escaped string value
