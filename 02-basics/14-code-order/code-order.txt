The (Un)Importance Of Code Order
--------------------------------
- When using the keywords "let" & "const"
    - It requires to declared ONLY ONCE
        - Done BEFORE accessing the constant or variable

    - Failing to do so
        - Triggers a "ReferenceError"


- A Function is NOT affected by the codebase's order
    - It can be declared ANYWHERE w/in the codebase

    - It will executed with NO issues when called


- When the browser reads a JavaScript code
    - It parses the codebase from TOP to bottom

    - Registers ALL of the defined Functions it finds
        - Then "moves" them to the TOP of the codebase

    - Recommended convention
        - Functions are to be declared at the TOP of the codebase

        - Some developers prefer at the BOTTOM
            - There is NO right way
        
        - Important thing is to be consistent
            - With the chosen convention (TOP or BOTTOM)
