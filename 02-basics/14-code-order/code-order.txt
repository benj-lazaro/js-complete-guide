The (Un)Importance Of Code Order
--------------------------------
- In JavaScript when using "let" or "const" keyword
    - Requires to be declared ONCE
    - Before accessing the constant or variable
    - Failing to do so triggers a "ReferenceError"


- A JavaScript function is NOT affected by the order of the code 
    - A function can be declared anywhere in the codebase
    - It will execute with no issues when called

    - When the browser reads a JavaScript code
        - It parses the entire codebase from top to bottom
        - It registers any defined functions(s) it finds
        - Then "pulls" the function(s) to the top of the codebase

    - In most cases, defining functions at the top of the codebase is recommended
        - Some developers prefer at the bottom
        - There is NO right way
        - Important is to be consistent with the chosen convention
