An Introduction To Global And Local Scope
-----------------------------------------
- Constant, variable & data defined INSIDE a function
    - This falls within the confines of Local (Block) Scope
    - It can NOT be accessed outside of a function
    - Even if a constant or variable has an IDENTICAL identifier outside a function


- Constant, variable & data defined OUTSIDE a function
    - This falls within the confines of Global Scope
    - It can be accessed inside a function


- A pure function is a function that:
    - Takes some input through the use of parameters
    - Returns an output through the use of a "return" statement
    - Does NOT directly access / manipulate anything from the Global Scope
