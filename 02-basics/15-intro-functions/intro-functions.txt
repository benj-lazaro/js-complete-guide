Introducting Functions
----------------------
- A function is a language construct that
    - Defines some code w/c can be executed at a later time   
    - Often referred as "code on demand"


    Syntax:
    function <name>([<parameter(s)>]) {
        ...
        [return <variable | value | expression>;]
    }

    Example:
    // Accepts two numbers & returns the sum
    function addTwoNumbers(number1, number2) {
        return sum = number1 + number2;
    }


- A function can optionally
    - Accept input(s) into it using parameter(s)
    - Return some value from it using a "return" statement


- When JavaScript code is loaded
    - It is read from top to bottom

    - Functions are registered & stored in memory
        - They are NOT IMMEDIATELY executed
        - They wait until a function is called


- A function is called w/in the main JavaScript code
    - Using the convention

        <function_name>([<parameter(s)]);
