Adding A Custom Function
------------------------
- Function(s) can be declared
    - At the top of the script
        - Below the constant & variable declarations

    - At the end of the script
        - Allows the entire code to be read from top to bottom
        - Registers all functions in memory
        - A function is "hoisted" at the top of the file when it is called (executed)


- Naming a function
    - Choose one that describes the action it will perform


- Function parameter variables
    - The values of these variables are available ONLY w/in the function

    - A function can have as many parameters it needs

    - Declared constants & variables w/in a function
        - Are AVAILABLE ONLY w/in the function
        - NOT AVAILABLE outside of the function
        - Categorized as LOCAL SCOPE


- Global-scope constant & variables
    - Declared OUTSIDE of a function
    - Accessible INSIDE & OUTSIDE of a function


- Local-scope constant & variables
    - Declared INSIDE of a function
    - Inaccessible OUTSIDE of a function


- On the starter project
    - Open the file "assets/scripts/app.js"

    - Declare a new function named "add()"
        - It has two (2) parameter variables named "num1" & "num2"

    - Inside the function
        - Declare a constant named "result"
            - Assigns the sum of the parameter variables
        
        - Calls a JavaScript built-in function "alert()"
            - Pass a string message & the constant "result"
            - To render it on the browser

    - Outside of the Function
        - Call the function "add()" twice
            - Each call passes their respective argument values
