Executing Functions Indirectly
------------------------------
- Refactor the code of app.js
    - Add an Event Listener to the constant addBtn (defined in vendor.js)
    - The constant constains a targeted HTML element in index.html

    - The .addEventListener() is a JavaScript method that
        - Set up a function to be called
        - Whenever a specified event occurred on the targeted element (addBtn)
        - Reference (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener)

    - Pass two argument values to .addEventListener()
        - 1st argument = name of event to listen to

        - 2nd argument = name function to be called when the event occurred
            - NOTE: Omit ( ) from the callback function to prevent from immediately being executed


    - Inside the callback function add()
        - Add the value of currentResult with userInput (defined in vendor.js)
            - The property .value = stored value 
        
        - Call outputResult() (defined in vendor.js) to render the result on the HTML document
