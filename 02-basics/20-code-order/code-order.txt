The (Un)importance Of Code Order
--------------------------------
- JavaScript keywords "const" & "let"
    - Required to be declared ONLY ONCE

    - Important to have them declared
        - BEFORE accessing (or using) them
    
    - Otherwise, it triggers an "Uncaught ReferenceError"


- A function is NOT affected by the code's order 
    - It can be declared ANYWHERE w/in the code base

    - Regardless where the function is declared
        - It will still execute w/out issues when called 
    
    - When a browser parses through the JavaScript code from top to bottom
        - Declared functions are registered in memory
        - Then are moved (hoisted) to the of the code base

    - Recommended convention
        - Declare functions at the top of the code base
            - Just below the declaration of constants & variables

        - Some prefer to declare at the bottom or middle
            - There is NO RIGHT WAY

        - NOTE: Important to stick w/ the chosen convention
