An Introduction To Global & Local Scope
---------------------------------------
- Global scope
    - Refers to a constant, variable or data declared OUTSIDE a function
    - They are ACCESSIBLE INSIDE & OUTSIDE of a function


- Local (i.e. block) scope
    - Refers to a constant, variable or data declared INSIDE a function
    - They are INACCESSIBLE OUTSIDE of a function
    

- It is possible to declare a variable globally
    - Then declare a variable (of the same name) locally w/in a function
        - That does NOT overwrite the value of the global variable

    - This process is referred as "shadowing"
        - Discussed on the next lesson


- A pure function is one that
    - Accepts input from outside via parameters
    - Returns an value using the "return" statement
    - Does NOT access or manipulate any value from the Global scope
