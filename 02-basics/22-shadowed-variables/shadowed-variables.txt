Shadowed Variables
------------------
- Declaring a variable of the same name twice
    - One at a Global & the other at a Local scope
        - NO error is triggered
        - Due to their declaration at being done on different scopes

    - This is referred as "shadowing"

    - The Local scope variable does NOT overwrite
        - The value stored in the Global scope variable of the same name

        - It ONLY works with the value assigned to it w/in the function
