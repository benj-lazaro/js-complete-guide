Indirect VS Direct Function Execution Summary
--------------------------------------------
- Calling a function using its name w/ a pair of ()
    - When JavaScript encounters this statement
        - It IMMEDIATELY executes the code of the function

    - This is referred as "direct execution"


- Calling a function using its name w/o a pair of ()
    - Tells JavaScript to register this function
        - It does NOT IMMEDIATELY execute the code of the function
    
    - Execute the function at some point in the future
        - e.g. When an "event" occurs

    - This is referred as "direct execution"


- NOTE: Passing a function w/ a pair of () as argument
    - To the method ".addEventListener()"
        - Informs JavaScript to register the event listener

        - BUT IMMEDIATELY executes the callback function
            - NOT waiting for the associated "event" to occur
