Adding A Reusable Function That Uses Objects
--------------------------------------------
- Refactor the codebase of app.js's add() function
    - Grab the code that generates a log of mathematical operations performed
    - Transfer it into a function of its own
    - So that other mathematical function can re-use it as well
