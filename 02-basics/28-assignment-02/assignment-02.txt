Assignment 02: Functions
------------------------
- Download and open the attached starter file


- Create two (2) new functions
    - First one that takes NO parameters
        - Simply show an "alert()" with some text of your choice

    - Second one
        - Receives a name as a parameter
        - Uses "alert()" to output that name


- Call both functions directly from your code


- Add an event listener to the constant "task3Element"
    - Listen to a "click" event
    - Callback the 1st function (the one w/o arguments)
    - Click this task thereafter to verify whether it works


- Add a new function
    - Takes three (3) parameters of string data type
    - Pass any three names you want
    - Returns the combined string (where the three strings are concatenated)


- Call the new function directly from your code
    - Send the result of that function to "alert()"
