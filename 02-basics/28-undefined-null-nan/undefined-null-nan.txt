Undefined, Null & NaN
---------------------
- Additional data types in JavaScript that contain special values
    - undefined
    - null
    - NaN (Not a Number)


- undefined
    - Default value of an uninitialized variable
    - NOT RECOMMENDED to manually assign an "undefined" value to a variable


- null 
    - Similar to undefined 
    - BUT it is NEVER used as a default value of an uninitialized variable
    - Often used to manually "reset" or "clear" the value of a variable
        - An alternative to assigning an empty string


- NaN (Not a Number)
    - Technicall is NOT a data type
    - It is a type of "number" that is NOT a number

    - It works like an error code when performing calculations
    - It is the result of a calculation that is INVALID
    - A calculation with a value that is NOT a number (e.g. string)
