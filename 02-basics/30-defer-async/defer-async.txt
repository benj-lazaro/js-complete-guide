Importing Scripts Correctly With defer & async
----------------------------------------------
- The "defer" is a boolean attribute of the <script> tag
    - Informs the browser to download the external JavaScript file right away
    - Load the JavaScript file as soon as possible
    - BUT executes the JavaScript file ONLY AFTER the HTML document has been parsed
        - The order of script execution is GUARANTEED

- NOTE: Recommended to import external JavaScript files within the <head> section
    - This loads the external JavaScript file in a more efficient way


- The "async" is a boolean attribute of the <script> tag
    - Informs the browser to download the external JavaScript file right away
    - Load the JavaScript file as soon as possible
    - BUT executes the JavaScript file IMMEDIATELY
        - HTML document parsing is paused
        - The order of script execution is NOT GUARANTEED
        
    - NOTE: Use for stand-alone script that DOES NOT RELY on HTML content / elements


- Both "async" and "defer" attributes are AVAILABLE ONLY for external JavaScript files
    - Both requires to work with the "src" attribute
