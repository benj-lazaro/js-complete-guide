Mixing Numbers & Strings
------------------------
- In the code example where a number and a string "number" is being added
    - Resulted into a concatenated string of numbers instead of the sum

    - This happens due to the "+" operator
        - Resulting to a "string concatenation"

        - This is the ONLY arithmetic operator supported by the string data type


- The NaN (i.e. Not A Number)
    - It is returned when an arithmetic operator besides "+"
        - Used between a pair of strings


- Using other arithmetic operators between a number & a string
    - JavaScript IMPLICITLY converts the string into a number
    - Then perform the corresponding arithmetic operation
