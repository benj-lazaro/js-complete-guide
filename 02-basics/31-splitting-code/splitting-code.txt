Splitting Code Into Functions
-----------------------------
- Refactoring the starter project
    - Address code repetition by placing then into their own specific function

    - Manually (directly) call the specific function w/in another function
    
    - NOTE: A general rule is to avoid code repetition as possible


- On the starter project
    - Open the file "assets/scripts/app.js"

    - Create a new function named "getUserNumberInput()"
        - Accepts NO argument value
        
        - Returns the value stored ni the constant "userInput.value"
            - Runs through the function "parseInt()"

    - Refactor the function "add()"
        - Declares a new constant named "enteredNumber"
            - Stores the returned value from the function "getUserNumberInput()"

        - Declares another constant named "calcDescription"
            - Stores the template literal of the arithmetic (mathematical) expression

    - Save the changes
