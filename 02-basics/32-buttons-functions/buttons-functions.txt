Connecting All Buttons To Functions
-----------------------------------
- Define respective callback functions that corresponds to
    - The event listeners of web-based calculator's buttons


- On the starter project
    - Open the file "assets/scripts/app.js"

    - Define a new function named "createAndWriteOutput()"
        - Accepts three (3) parameters
            - "operator"            = arithmetic operator as string
            - "resultBeforeCalc"    = a copy of the "currentResult" value
            - "calcNumber"          = value from the "getUserNumberInput()"

        - Stores the argument values as a template literal
            - In a constant named "calcDescription"

        - Calls the function "outputResult()" passes the following as arguments
            - Global variable "currentResult"
            - Local constant "calcDescription"

    - Refactor the function "add()"
        - Define a new constant "initialResult"
            - Stores the value of the global variable "currentResult"

        - At the end of the code block
            - Call the function "createAndWriteOutput()", pass the arguments
                - 1st   = arithmetic operator as a string
                - 2nd   = value of the local constant "initialResult"
                - 3rd   = value of the local constant "enteredNumber"

    - Duplicate the function "add()" three (3) times
        - Rename the name respectively as
            - "subtract()"
            - "multiply()"
            - "divide()"

        - Refactor the arithmetic operators

        - Refactor the 1st argument value passed to "createAndWriteOutput()"

    - Link the callback functions to the corresponding buttons in "index.html"
        - Use the constant variables defined in the file assets/scripts/vendor.js
        - The event to listen is "click"

    - Save the changes

    - Load / reload the browser
        - Test the buttons
