Working With Code Comments
--------------------------
- JavaScript comments 
    - Are IGNORED & NOT executed by the JavaScript Engine

    - To make the code readable (understandable) for 
        - Other develoeprs
        - Yourself after coming back at a later time
    
    - Implemented in the form of a
        - Single line comment
        - Block or multi-line comment (for longer comments)

    - A comment should
        - Be & "to-the-point" content that is NOT obvious by looking at it
        - NOT point out the obvious
        - Refrain from adding redundant information
        

    Syntax:
    // single line comment

    /* This is
       a block or multi-line
       comment
    */
