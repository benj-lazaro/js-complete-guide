More Operators!
---------------
- Shorthand mathematical (arithmetic) operators
    - Performing an arithmetic operation
    - Then assigning the result to the same variable


    Syntax:
    <variable_name> += <value>;
    <variable_name> -= <value>;
    <variable_name> *= <value>;
    <variable_name> /= <value>;


- The "++" and "--" operators
    - Referred as the "incrementor" & "decrementor" operator, respectively
    - It increments & decrements the value in a variable by 1

    - NOTE: This is NOT available for multiplication & division operation
        -As multiplying or dividing a value by 1 yields the same result


    Syntax:
    <variable_name>++;  // Increments a value by 1 AFTER reading the expression
    ++<variable_name>;  // Increments a value by 1 BEFORE reading the expression

    <variable_name>--;  // Decrements a value by 1 AFTER reading the expression
    --<variable_name>;  // Decrements a value by 1 BEFORE reading the expression
