Using Arrays
------------
- An array is used for storing a list of (unlimited amount) data
    - It can be declared as uninitialized


    Syntax:
    <variable_name> = []; // Uninitialized array
    <variable_name> = [<element_1>, <element_2>, ..., <element_n>];

    - Reference (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array)


- To add an element into an array
    - Use the array method ".push()"
        - Pass the new element as an argument value

    - Reference (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/push)


- To access (read) a specific element w/in an array
    - Use the element's index value (position w/in an array)
        - Returns the referenced element

    - Accessing a non-existent element
        - Returns a "undefined" value

    - NOTE: JavaScript's array starts at 0 (i.e. zero-based index)
   

    Syntax:
    <variable_name> = <array_name>[<index_value>];


    Example:
    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    numbers[0]; // Refers to the element 1


- On the starter project
    - Open the file "assets/scripts/app.js"

    - Use an array to keep track of the arithmetic operations performed
        - To store this information as an internal log
        - Theoretically to be sent to a server or locally write into a file

    - Create a global variable named "logEntries"
        - Initialize it with an empty array

    - Refactor the function "add()"
        - At the last line of code

        - Attach the method ".push()" to the array "logEntries"

        - Pass the constant "enteredNumber" as argument value
            - To push its stored value into the array as a new element

        - To view the content of the array "logEntries"
            - Pass the array as an argument value to the function "console.log()"

    - Save the changes

    - Load / reload the browser
        - Open the Dev Tools
        
        - Click the tab "Console"
            - To view the content of the array "logEntries"
