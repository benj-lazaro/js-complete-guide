Objects Common Syntax Gotchas
-----------------------------
- When creating an object using a pair pf "{ }"
    - Use a ";" at the closing "}"


- Each key-value pair w/in an object is separated using a ","
    - NOT using a ";"
    - Doing so would result to a syntax error


- A value assign to an object's property uses ":"
    - NOT using a "="
