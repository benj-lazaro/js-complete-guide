Accessing Object Data
---------------------
- To access the value assigned to an object's property
    - NOTE: The property refers to the "key" part of an object's key-value pair

    Syntax:
    <object_name>.<property_name>


- On the starter project
    - Open the file "assets/scripts/app.js"

    - To demonstrate access to a property of an object
        - Right after pushing the object "logEntry" into the array "logEntries"

        - Declare the function "console.log()"
            - Pass "logEntry.operation" as argument value

            - Access the property "operation" of the object "logEntry"

    - Save the changes

    - Load / reload the web browser
        - Launch Chrome's Dev Tools
        
        - Click the tab "Console" to view (access) the value of the property "operation"
