undefined, null & NaN
---------------------
- The (data type &) special value "undefined"
    - It is the DEFAULT value of an uninitialized variable
    
    - It is a value that indicates that nothing is there 

    - NEVER assign the value "undefined" to a variable
    

- The special value "null"
    - It is a data type of "object"

    - Similar to "undefined" that indicates nothing is there 

    - Assigning the value "null" to a variable
        - Clears or resets the previously stored value


- The special value "NaN" (Not a Number)
    - It is a data type of "number"
        - Despite representing a value that is NOT a number

    - Works like an error code when performing calculations
        - Referring to an invalid result 
        - e.g. Performed a mathematical operation with a string value
