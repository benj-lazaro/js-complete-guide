Importing Scripts Correctly With "defer" & "async"
--------------------------------------------------
- HTML attribute "defer"
    - Informs the browser to
        - Download the external JavaScript file right away
        - Load the script as soon as possible
        - Does NOT execute until the HTML document is parsed


- HTML attribute "async"
        - Download the external JavaScript file right away
        - Load the script as soon as possible
        - Execute the script IMMEDIATELY does NOT WAIT until the HTML document is parsed

    - Does NOT guarantee the "order of execution" of the JavaScript file(s) will be followed
        - It executes the JavaScript file that gets downloaded first

    - Recommended ONLY for stand-alone JavaScript file that
        - Does NOT access / manipulate elements of the HTML document 


- It is recommended to place the import of external JavaScript file(s)
    - W/in the <head> section of the HTML document
        - Loads the external JavaScript files more efficiently

    - It does NOT wait for the entire HTML document to be parsed
        - Before downloading & loading the external JavaScript file(s)

    - Use either HTML attribute "async" or "defer"
        - Depending on the use case 
        
    - NOTE: Both HTML attributes "async" & "defer" are ONLY for use with external JavaScript files
