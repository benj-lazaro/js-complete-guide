Efficident Development & Debugging: An Overview
-----------------------------------------------
- How to write code efficiently
    - NOT writing code as quickly as possible

    - Get a lot out of the tools
        - Write out w/o too much copy-and-paste (manual work)

    - Work in a productive environment
        - Environment = code editor

        - Configure the code editor
            - To make working with it comfortable
            - To auto complete & format one's own code
        
        - Utilize important shortcuts
        
        - Explore code extensions & settings


- How to find help
    - Encountering use cases NOT sure how to solve

    - The goal is NOT to learn ALL JavaScript
        - Features, functions, methods, etc. by heart
        
        - This is IMPOSSIBLE as any programming languages evolve over time

    - Learn how a programming language generally work
        - How to think about writing it in code
        
        - Know where to find help & dive deeper for 
            - A specific feature, function, method, etc.


- How to debug your own code
    - To be able to find & fix error(s) in one's own code
