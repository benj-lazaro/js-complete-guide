Utilizing Different IDE Views
-----------------------------
- VS Code offers different views (or modes)
    - Extensions        = browse, install & remove extensions
    - Explorer          = display files and folder currently working on
    - Search            = search through current project files 
    - Source Control    = displays GUI on source control of project files / folders
    - Debug             = helps understand how the code executes, find and fix errors
