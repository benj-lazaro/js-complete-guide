- MDN (Mozilla Developer Network)
    - Online documentation on web technologies including CSS, HTML and JavaScript since 2005
    - Somewhat like the official JavaScript documentation
    - Website (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/)


- Other online sources: Google
    - Website (https://www.google.com)


- Learn how to ask proper questions
    - Ask in a way that allows others to help 
        - Desribe the problem
        - Copy & paste the encountered error message 
        - Help others, be friendly


- No matter how seasoned as a developer 
    - You will encounter a lot of trial and error
    - Don't give up, keep on trying, keep tweaking the code, Google & come back
