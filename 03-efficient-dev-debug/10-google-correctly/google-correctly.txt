How To Google Correctly
-----------------------
- To Google a topic correctly
    - Declare the programming language first (e.g. JavaScript)
    - Followed by a short description of how a targeted function (or idea) works

    - Entries from StackOverflow (popular development forum) is helpful (most of the time)
