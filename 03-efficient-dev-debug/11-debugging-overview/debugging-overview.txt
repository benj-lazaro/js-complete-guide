Debugging JavaScript An Overview
--------------------------------
- Two kinds of errors to be encountered when writing code
    - Errors that crashes the application
        - Generates an error message 

    - Errors that does NOT crash the application but behaves incorrectly
        - Logical error
        - Application does NOT execute as intended


- To address errors through debugging 
    - Read the error message
        - Often the error is clearly stated
        - If it is NOT clear then Google it

    - Use JavaScript's console.log() statement
        - Outputs information on the Console window of the browser's Dev Tools
        - Views the value stored in a variable throughout the execution of the code

    - Use modern browser's built-in debugging tools
        - Referring to the Dev Tools

    - Use IDE's (e.g. VS Code) debugging tools
        - Provides a way to debug and fix error(s)
