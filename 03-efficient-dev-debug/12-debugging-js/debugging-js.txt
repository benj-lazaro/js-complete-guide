Debugging JavaScript: An Overview
---------------------------------
- Two (2) types of errors to encounter when writing code
    - An error that crash an application
        - It shows an error message

    - An error that does NOT crash an application
        - It does NOT show an error message
            - Application does NOT execute as intended

        - This is referred to as a "logical error"


- To address an error through debugging 
    - Read & utiltiize the error message
        - An error message is (often) clearly stated
        - If the error message NOT clear or easily understood, Google it

    - Use JavaScript's "console.log()" statement
        - To gain insight into the code
        - Outputs information on the browser's Console window
        - Views the stored value in a variable during code execution
        - NOTE: Can be cumbersome for large code base

    - Use Chrome & VS Code's debugging tools
        - To identify & fix the error
