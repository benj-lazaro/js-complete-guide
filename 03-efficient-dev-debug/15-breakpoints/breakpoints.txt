Next-Level Debugging With Chrome Devtools & Breakpoints
-------------------------------------------------------
- A breakpoint
    - Tells the browser to "stop" code execution
        - When a certain part of the code is reached

    - It allows to look into the code at its current state during execution


- To place a breakpoint
    - On the Chrome Dev Tools' "Source" tab
        - Select & click the JavaScript file to troubleshoot

    - Click on the code's line number
        - Corresponding line number is highlighted

        - NOTE: Multiple breakpoints can be placed

    - When the script is run
        - The code execution pauses when it reaches a breakpoint
            - NOTE: To resume execution, click the button "Resume script execution"
        
        - The line of code is highlighted in Blue

        - Hover the mouse pointer over a variable
            - To view the current stored value

    - It provides the ability to "step" & read the next line of code
        - If the next line is a function call

        - It offers the option
            - To "step into" the function's code
                - Go through it line-by-line
                - View the value of local scope variable(s)

            - To "step over" the function call
                - Skips going into the function's code
                - Move to the next line of code instead

            - To "setup out" of a function
                - Gets out of the function's code
                - Move back to the main program's line of code


- To place a conditional breakpoint
    - The same as setting a normal breakpoint EXCEPT
        - Perform a right-mouse click at the targeted line of code
        
    - Select the menu option "Add conditional breakpoint..."
        - Provide a conditional statement & press ENTER

    - Highlights the line of code in Orange


- To place an event listener breakpoint
    - The same as setting a normal breakpoint

    - On the tab "Event Listener Breakpoints"
        - Select the event to listen (e.g. Mouse -> click)

    - Highlights the line of code in Blue


- The Chrome Dev Tools' "Call Stack" tab
    - Lists all the functions that have been called

    - The function at the top of the "stack"
        - Refers to the function that is currently running

    - The function(s) below the top of the "stack"
        - Are responsible that lead to the current running function

    - Show the order of the script's code execution

    
- The Chrome Dev Tools' "Scope" tab
    - Offers a list of "Local" & "Global" scope constants, variables, functions & more
    
    - Assigned values of the variables
        - Can tentatively changed to help troubleshoot a logical error


- The Chrome Dev Tools' "Watch" tab
    - Offers to set a "watcher" by clicking the "+" button
        - Keeps track of how things change during code execution
    
    - Setting a variable
        - Allows to see the changes of the assigned value
        
    - Setting an expression
        - Allows to see the changes of the evaluated result

    - NOTE: Setting of a watcher will be cleared when the browser reloads the HTML document
