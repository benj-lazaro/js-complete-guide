Debugging Code Directly Inside VS Code
--------------------------------------
- To set a breakpoint in VS Code
    - Formerly required installing the extension "Debugger for Chrome"
        - This extension is not deprecated
        - VS Code comes with a bundled JavaScript debugger
        - Offers the same functionality and much more


    - Click on the left-hand side of the code's line number
        - Generates a Red dot

    - Next debug directly inside VS Code
        - Click Run -> Start Debugging
        - Launches the Run (formerly Debugging) View
            
        - Offers the same tools of the Source tab of the Chrome Devtools
            - VS Code's Debug Console tab outputs log messages
            - This is similar to Chrome's Console tab
