Using Booleans In Conditions & More On Text Comparisons
-------------------------------------------------------
- Keep in mind that the condition in an "if" statement
    - Simply has to be a boolean value (i.e. "true" or "false")

    - Often using conditional operators
        - To yield a boolean value w/o changing the variables or values you're working on

    - Since an "if" statement ONLY wants a boolean value
        - The conditional is NOT ALWAYS needed
        
        - A variable can store a boolean value does NOT require a conditional statement

        - The conditional operator "!"
            - Will negate the boolean value in a variable


- Conditional operators "<" and ">"
    - Can also be used on a value of string data type

    - JavaScript compares strings based on
        - Standard lexicographical ordering using Unicode values

    - JavaScript ALWAYS look at the 1st character
        - ONLY considers other characters if the 1st character is similar

    - NOTE: Uppercase characters are considered "smaller or lower" than lowercase characters
