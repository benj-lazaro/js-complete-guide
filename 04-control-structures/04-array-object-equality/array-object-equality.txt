Beware When Comparing Objects & Arrays For Equality
---------------------------------------------------
- Using the === or == operators to compare values of arrays and objects
    - Will ALWAYS yield a value of "false"
    - Even if they both arrays / objects have identical values


- Both arrays and objects are considered special in JavaScript
    - Each individual array / object created
    - Store their respective values at a specific addresses in memory

    - Using the == or === operators between two arrays / objects with identical values
        - Will yield the value of "false"
        - Due to each being located at different addresses in memory


- However, comparing individual items (array) or properties (object) between arrays / objects
    - With identical values using the === or == operators
    - Will yield the value of "true"


Example:

> const person1 = {name: "Max"};
> const person2 = {name: "Max"};

> person1 === person2;
< false

> person1 == person2;
< false

> const person3 = person1;          // However assigning the value of an object to another variable
> person1 === person3               // Points to the same area in memory therefore returns true
< true


> const hobbies = ["Sports", "Cooking"];
> const moreHobbies = ["Sports", "Cooking"];
> hobbies === moreHobbies;
< false

> person1.name === person2.name;    // Comparing properties between two objects if equal
< true                              // Yields true

> hobbies[0] === moreHobbies[0];    // Comparing items between two arrays if equal
< true                              // Yields true
