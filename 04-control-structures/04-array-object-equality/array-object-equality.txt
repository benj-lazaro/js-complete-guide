Beware When Comparing Objects & Arrays For Equality
---------------------------------------------------
- When comparing values of two Arrays and Object using the === or == operators
    - ALWAYS yield a false value
        - Regardless if they have identical values

    - The reason being is that Arrays and Objects are special in JavaScript
        - An Array is technically an Object

    - Each defined Array or Object occupies
        - Stores their assigned value at a specific location in memory
        - Comparing with another Array / Object despite having identical values
            - It will NEVER be equal 


- HOWEVER, comparing the value of an array item or object property with another
    - Using comparison operators == or === 
    - Yelds the value of true


Example:

> const person1 = {name: "Max"};
> const person2 = {name: "Max"};

> person1 === person2;
< false

> person1 == person2;
< false

> const person3 = person1;          // However assigning the value of an object to another variable
> person1 === person3               // Points to the same area in memory therefore returns true
< true


> const hobbies = ["Sports", "Cooking"];
> const moreHobbies = ["Sports", "Cooking"];
> hobbies === moreHobbies;
< false

> person1.name === person2.name;    // Comparing properties between two objects if equal
< true                              // Yields true

> hobbies[0] === moreHobbies[0];    // Comparing items between two arrays if equal
< true                              // Yields true
