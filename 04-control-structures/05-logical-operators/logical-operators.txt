The Logical AND & OR Operators
------------------------------
- The logical AND yields the boolean value of true
    - If both conditions are true
    - Otherwise yields the boolean value of false


- The logical OR yields the boolean value of true
    - If one of the condition is true
    - Otherwise the boolean value of false


- A conditional statement using both AND and OR operators
    - The 1st and 2nd operands are evaluated first
        - If both yields the boolean value of true
            - It DISREGARDS the 3rd operand

    - The 3rd operand is evaluated as an alternative
        - If the OR operator and 3rd operand yields a boolean value of true
            - It DISREGARDS the AND operator yielding a boolean value of false

    - Using a parenthesis controls the evaluation of a logical statement
