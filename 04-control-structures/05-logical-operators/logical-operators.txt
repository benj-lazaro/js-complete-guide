The Logical AND & OR Operators
------------------------------
- The logical AND yields the boolean value of "true"
    - If both conditions are "true"
    - Otherwise yields the boolean value of "false"


- The logical OR yields the boolean value of "true"
    - If one of the condition is "true"
    - Otherwise the boolean value of "false"


- A conditional statement using AND & OR operators
    - The 1st and 2nd operands are evaluated first
    - If it yields the boolean value of "true"
    - It disregards the 3rd operand

    - The 3rd operatnd is evaluated as an alternative
    - If the OR operator & 3rd operand yields the boolean value of "true"
    - It DISREGARDS the AND operator, yielding the boolean value of "false"


- To gain control on the evaluation of a logical statement
    - Use a parenthesis
