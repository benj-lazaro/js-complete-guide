Coding Exercise 06: Getting Started With "if" Statements
--------------------------------------------------------
- Your task is to set the value of the defined variable "userCategory" conditionally
    - The value of "userCategory" depends on the value of the variable "age"
    
        - If "age" < 18, the value of "userCategory" is "child"

        - If "age" is between 18 and 65, the value of "userCategory" is "adult"
            - The value of 18 is included
            - The value of 65 is excluded
        
        - For all other ages, the value of "userCategory" is "senior"

    - Put ALL of the conditional code into the pre-defined function "solve()"
