Beware When Comparing Objects & Arrays For Equality
---------------------------------------------------
- Using the operators "===" and "==" to perform an equality check
    - Between arrays or objects respectively ALWAYS evaluate to "false"
        - Both are considered SPECIAL in JavaScript
        - NOTE: An array is basically an object
    
    - For every individual array or object created
        - Each is assigned to a SPECIFIC ADDRESS in memory

        - On this SPECIFIC ADDRESS is where
            - Their assigned elements (array) or properties (object) are stored       
   
    - When comparing between two arrays or objects, respectively
        - They end up comparing SPECIFIC ADDRESSES in memory 
            - NOT the identical stored values
            - This ALWAYS evaluates to "false"

     
    Example:
    const person1 = {name: "Max"};
    const person2 = {name: "Max"};
    
    const hobbies = ["Sports", "Cooking"];
    const moreHobbies = ["Sports", "Cooking"];

    person1 === person2; // Evaluates to false
    hobbies === moreHobbies; // Evaluates to false


- In order to compare the stored values between two arrays or objects, respectively
    - Use the operators "===" or "==" 
        - To compare specific elements (array) or properties (object) that stores identical values
        - Identical values will evaluate to "true"


    Example:
    person1.name === person2.name; // Evaluates to true
    hobbies[0] === moreHobbies[0]; // Evaluates to true
