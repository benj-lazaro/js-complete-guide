The Logical AND & OR operators
------------------------------
- The logical "&&" (AND) operator
    - Evaluates to "true" if BOTH conditions are "true"
    - Otherwise, evaluates to "false"
    - Reference (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Logical_AND)


- The logical "||" (OR) operator
    - Evaluates to "true" if EITHER ONE of the conditions is "true"
    - Otherwise, evaluates to "false"
    - Reference (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Logical_OR)


- Combining "&&" and "||" operators in a conditional statement
    - In a three (3) conditions statement where
        - Between the 1st & 2nd condition, uses the "&&" operator
        - Between the 2nd & 3rd condition, uses the "||" operator

    - If BOTH 1st & 2nd condition evaluates to "true"
        - Then the 3rd condition is disregarded

    - If BOTH 1st & 2nd condition evaluates to "false"
        - Then the 3rd condition is considered for evaluation

    - If BOTH 1st & 2nd condition evaluates to "false" & the 3rd condition evaluates to "true"
        - Then the 1st & 2nd conditions are disregarded
    
    - NOTE: Use a pair of ( ) to control what's evaluated together


- On the starter project
    - Open the file "assets/scripts/app.js"

    - Refactor the function "calculateResult()"
        - Implement a conditional statement 
            - Using the logical AND
        
        - Check if the correct argument value for the parameter "calculationType" is passed
            - Otherwise issue a "return" statment
