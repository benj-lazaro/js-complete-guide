Understanding Operator Precedence
---------------------------------
- Operator precedence
    - Describes the order on w/c operators are executed
    
    - The value yielded by a higher precedence operator
        - Serves as an operand (input) to a lower precedence operator

    - MDN Precedence table
        - NOTE: Table lists operators in order from highest precedence (18) to lowest precedence (1)
        - Reference (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Operator_Precedence#table)

    - Reference (https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_precedence.asp)


- Math operators follows the PEMDAS precedence
    - Parenthesis (highest precedence)
    - Exponentiation
    - Multiplication
    - Division
    - Addition
    - Subtraction (lowest precedence)


- Logical operators
    - ! (NOT)
    - && (AND)
    - || (OR)
