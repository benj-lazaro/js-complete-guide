Coercion VS Conversion
----------------------
- JavaScript is able to use variables in a condition w/o using comparison operators
    - It coerces a value (stored in a variable) to produce a boolean value
        - Then evaluates the condition

    - NOTE: Coerce = convert w/o really converting
        - JavaScript does NOT convert the variable's value to a boolean value   


- The comparison operators (e.g. "===") in a condition
    - Generates & returns a boolean value
    - It uses the returned boolean value in evaluating a condition
