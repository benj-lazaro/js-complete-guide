Adding An "Attack" Function
---------------------------
- To start
    - Add an "Attack" callback function to the button "ATTACK"
    
    - When a user clicks the button "ATTACK"
        - The monster's health bar shrinks

    - NOTE: Common convention for global scope constant or variable w/ hard-coded value
        - To be written in uppercase
        - In-between words separated by a "_" character

    - NOTE: Specifically for this project
        - Convention of naming function that handles an event
        - Will have the suffix "Handler" attached to its name (e.g. attackHandler)


- On the starter project
    - Open the file "assets/scripts/app.js"

    - Define a global constant named "ATTACK_VALUE"
        - Initially hard code the value of 10
        - NOTE: Naming convention for constants or variables w/ a hard-coded value

    - Define the following global variables named
        - "chosenMaxLife"           = assign w/ the value of 100
        - "currentMonsterHealth"    = assign w/ the value of the global variable "chosenMaxLife"
        - "currentPlayerHealth"     = assign w/ the value of the global variable "chosenMaxLife"

    - Call the function "adjustHealthBars()"
        - Defined in the file "scripts/vendor.js"
        - Renders the current health bar of both monster & player
        - Pass the global variable "chosenMaxLife" as argument value

    - Define a function named "attackHandler()"
    
    - Inside the function "attackHandler()"
        - Define a local constant named "damage"
            - Accepts the returned value from calling the function "dealMonsterDamage()"

            - The function "dealMonsterDamage()"
                - Passes the global constant "ATTACK_VALUE" as argument value

        - The global variable "currentMonsterHealth"
            - Receives the evaluated value from the expression "currentMonsterHealth - damage"

    - Attach the method ".addEventListener()"
        - To the global constant "attackBtn"

        - Pass the argument values
            - 1st   = event "click"
            - 2nd   = callback function "attackHandler()"
