Utilizing Global Constants As Identifiers In Conditional Code
-------------------------------------------------------------
- A common code pattern is using global constants as an identifier
    - Whose assigned value will be evaluated in a conditional statement

    - Instead of using string identifiers directly in a conditional statement
        - An unintentional typo might break the code

    - The idea is to define the string value once (in the global constant)
        - To prevent from introducing a typo within the latter part of the code
