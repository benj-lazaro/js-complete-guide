Utilizing Global Constants As Identifiers In Conditional Code
-------------------------------------------------------------
- A common code pattern is using global constant as an identifier
    - The assigned value will be evaluated in a conditional statements

    - Instead of using "string" identifiers directly (in a conditional statement)
        - Which may break the code due to an unintended typo

    - The idea behind is to define a string value ONCE (in a global constant )
        - To prevent from introducing unintended typos within the latter part of the code
