Using "if" Statements For Checking The Win Condition 
----------------------------------------------------
- Implement "if" statements on the project starter
    - To check if either the player or monster wins
    - Every time the "ATTACK" button is clicked


- On the starter project
    - Open the file "assets/scripts/app.js"

    - Declare a new global constant named "MONSTER_ATTACK_VALUE"
        - Assign it with a hard-coded number of 14

    - On the function attackHandler()
        - Right after the line that declares the local constant "damage"
        
        - Declare a new local constant named "playerDamage"
            - Calls the function "dealPlayerDamage()"
                - With the global constant "MONSTER_ATTACK_VALUE" as argument value

            - Stores the returned value as its current assigned value
            
        - Right after the line where the global variable "currentMonsterHealth"
            - Stores the value of itself minus the value of the local constant "damage"

            - The global variable constant "currentPlayerHealth" is
                - Assigned w/ its current value minus the value of the local constant "playerDamage"

        - Implement a series of "if" & "if else" statements
            - Checks the current health bars of both monster & player 
            
            - Uses the JavaScript function "alert()"
                - To display the corresponding message who wins

                - NOTE: The function "alert()" when called
                    - Tenatively halts the rendering of the content on the browser

                    - Resulting to displaying the message who win
                        - Before the health bars are updated

                - A "draw" message if BOTH monster & player have depleted
                    - Their respective health bars down to 0

        - Save the changes

        - Load / reload the browser
            - Test the button "ATTACK"
