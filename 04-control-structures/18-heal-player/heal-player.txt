Time For A "Heal Player" Functionality
--------------------------------------
- Link an event listener for the "HEAL" button
    - Executes the corresponding callback function "strongAttackHandler()" when it occurs


- On the starter project
    - Open the file "assets/scripts/app.js"

    - Create a new global constant named "HEAL_VALUE"
        - Assign a hardcoded value of 20

    - Create a new function named "endRound()"
    
    - Switch to the function "attackMonster()"
        - Cut the code from where the monster attack the Player
            - Up to the "if" statements that determines who win the current endRound

    - Switch back to the function "endRound()"
        - Paste the code

    - Switch back to the function "attackMonster()"
        - After the line of code where the global variable "currentMonsterHealth"
            - Is assigned the difference between the variables "currentMonsterHealth & "damage"

        - Call the function "endRound()"


    - Create a callback function named "healPlayerHandler()"
        - Create a new local variable named "healValue"

        - Define an "if" statement that checks
            - If the value of the global variable "currentPlayerHealth" is equal or greater than
                - The difference of the global variables "chosenMaxLife" & global constant "HEAL_VALUE"

            - If true, assign the difference between 
                - The global variables "chosenMaxLife" & "currentPlayerHealth" to the local variable "healValue"

            - Otherwise, assign the value of the global constant "HEAL_VALUE to the local variable "healValue"

        - Call the function "increasePlayerHealth()"
            - Pass the local variable "healValue" as argument value
            - NOTE: This ONLY updates the player's UI health bar, NOT the actual health value

        - Assign the sum of the global variable "currentPlayerHealth" & local variable "healValue"
            - To itself (i.e. "currentPlayerHealth")

        - Call the function "endRound()"


    - At the bottom of the file "app.js"
        - On the global constant "healBtn" defined in the file "scripts/vendor.js"

        - Attach the event handler that
            - Listen to a "click" event
            - That excutes the callback function "healPlayerHandler()" it occurs
