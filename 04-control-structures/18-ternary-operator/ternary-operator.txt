Ternary Operator
----------------
- The Ternary operator takes 3 operands:
    - A conditional expression
    - Followed by a "?"
    - Then an expression to be executed if the condition is truthy
    - Followed by a ":"
    - Finally an expression to be executed if the condition is falsy


Syntax:

condition ? exprIfTrue : exprIfFalse


- The Ternary operator addresses the following limitations of the if statement
    - The if statement  does NOT return a value

    - The if statement can NOT be used in an assignment statement where:
        - A conditional statement is expected to return a value
        - A value that will be assigned to a variable 


- It is ideal for short conditional statements and value assignments
    - Use the if statement for complex conditions and more complex values
