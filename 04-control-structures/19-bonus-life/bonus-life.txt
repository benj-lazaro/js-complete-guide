Controlling The Conditional Bonus Life (Without Boolean Operators)
------------------------------------------------------------------
- Implement a passive feature known as "bonus life"
    - Rendered as a UI labeled "1"

    - Trigger when the player's current health is 0 
        - Restores the player's health prior to being slained by the monster

        - Grants the opportunity to
            - Heal
            - Launch an attack (normal or strong) against the monster

        - Shows an alert message that the bonus life has been triggered
            - Corresonding UI button disppears


- On the starter project
    - Open the file "assets/scripts/app.js"

    - Declare a new global variable named "hasBonuslife"
        - Assign a boolean value of "true"

    - On the function "endRound()"
        - Create a new local constant named "initialPlayerHealth"
            - Assign the value of global variable "currentPlayerHealth"

        - Prior to the "if" statements that check who win the current round
            
        - Implement an "if" statement that checks whether the player's
            - Current health is below or equal to 0 AND has a "bonus life" left

        - If the condition is truthy
            - Set the global variable "hasBonuslife" to the boolean value of "false"

            - Calls the function "removeBonusLife()"
                - Defined in the file "assets/scripts/vendor.js"
                - Effectively removes the UI labeled "1"

            - Assign the value of the local variable "initialPlayerHealth"
                - To the global variable "currentPlayerHealth"
                - Effectively implementing the "bonus life"

            - Calls the function setPlayerHealth()
                - Pass the updated value of the global variable "currentPlayerHealth" as argument
        
            - Calls the function "alert()"
                - Sends a message that the "bonus life" has been applied

            
    - Save the changes

    - Load / reload the browser
        - Test the "bonus life" feature
