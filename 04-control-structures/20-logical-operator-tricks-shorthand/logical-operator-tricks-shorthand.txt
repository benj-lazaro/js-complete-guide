Logical Operator Tricks & Shorthands
------------------------------------
- A "boolean coercion" can be done using a double NOT operator "!!"
    - It coerces a truthy / falsy value into a real boolean "true" / "false" value

    - This type conversion trick is used 
        - When there is a need to work with real boolean values
        - Instead of working with falsy / truhty values

    - Common use case
        - To check if a user provided a truhty user input

            !!1     // Converts the truthy value into a real boolean value of true
            !!""    // Converts the falsy value into a real boolean value of false


- Assigning a default value using the OR operator "||"
    - If the 1st value (operand) is truhty
    - JavaScript IMMEDIATELY assigns said value (operand) to a constant / variable
    - JavaScript does NOT evaluate the 2nd value (operand) anymore

    - If the 1st value (operand) is falsy
    - JavaScript evaluates the 2nd value (operand) if it is falsy / truhty
    - JavaScript then assigns the value (operand) to a constant / variable

    - Common use case
        - To ensure that a value will be assigned to a constant / variable
        - NOTE: The AND "&&" and OR "||" operators does NOT GENERATED boolean values


- Assigning a value of the 2nd operand to a constant / variable
    - If the 1st value (operand) is truhty using the AND operator "&&"

    
Example:

const name = isLoggedIn && "Max"    // Assigns the string "Max" if the value in isLoggedIn is truthy
