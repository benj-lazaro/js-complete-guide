Logical Operator Tricks & Shorthands
------------------------------------
- Boolean coercion via double NOT operator !!
    - Coerces a truthy or falsy value into a real boolean value

    - A type convertion trick when there is a need to work with a real boolean values
        - Instead of falsy or truthy values

    - Common use case is to check if a user provided a truthy user input

    Example:
    !!1     // Converts the truthy value into a real boolean value of true
    !!""    // Converts the falsy value into a real boolean value of false


- Default value assignment via the OR operator ||
    - If the 1st value (operand) is truthy
        - JavaScript immediately assigns the said value to a constant or variable
        - It does NOT evaluate the 2nd value

    - If the 1st value (operand) is falsy
        - JavaScript evaluates the 2nd value if it is falsy or truthy
        - It assigns the 2nd value (operand) to a constant or variable

    - Common use case is to ensure that a constant or variable will have an assigned default value
    - NOTE: The && and || operators does NOT generate a boolean value

    Example:
    const name = someInput || "Max"     // Assigns the value in someInput if truthy, otherwise assigns the string "Max"


- Assigns a value to a constant or variable if 1st value (operand) is truhty via the AND operator &&
    - Used when intending to get the 2nd value (operand) to be assigned to a constant or variable
    
    Example:
    const name = isLoggedIn && "Max"    // Assigns the string "Max" if the value in isLoggedIn is truthy
