Adding A "Reset Game" Functionality
-----------------------------------
- Implement a reset game functionality that
    - Resets the game once it is over
    
    - It does NOT reset the "bonus life"
        - Exists ONLY ONCE across ALL (current) games

    - Resets the health of the monster & player
        - As well as their corresponding health bars (UI)
        - Calling the pre-defined function "resetGame()"


- On the starter project
    - Open the file "assets/scripts/app.js"

    - Create a new function named "reset()"
        - Assign the value of the global variable "chosenMaxLife" to the global variables
            - "currentMonsterHealth"
            - "currentPlayerHealth"
        
        - Call the function "resetGame()"
            - Defined in the file "assets/scripts/vendor.js"
            - Pass the global variable "chosenMaxLife" as argument value

    - In the function "endRound()"
        - Add a new "if" statements that check if EITHER values of the global variables
            - "currentMonsterHealth" OR "currentPlayerHealth" is less than or equal to 0

        - If the condition evaluates to truthy
            - Call the function "reset()"

    - Save the changes

    - Load / reload the browser
        - Test the reset game functionality
