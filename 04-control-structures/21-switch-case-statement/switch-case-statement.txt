Working With the switch-case Statement
--------------------------------------
- The switch statement evaluates an expression (that yields a value)
    - By matching the expression's value against a series of "case" clauses
    - Executes statements after the first "case" clause with matching value
    - Until a "break" statement is encountered

    - The "default" clause of a switch statement will be jumped to
        - If NO case matches the expression's value

    - Reference (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/switch)


Syntax:

switch (expression) {
  case caseExpression1:
    statements
  case caseExpression2:
    statements
  // …
  case caseExpressionN:
    statements
  default:
    statements
}


- A break statement terminates the current loop or switch statement
    - Transfers program control to the statement following the terminated statement
    - Reference (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/break)


- Common use case of switch-case statement
    - Multiple equality checks
    - Executes different code based on the condition that was met 
    - An effective replacement for multiple if (and else-if) statements
