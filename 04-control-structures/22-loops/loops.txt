Introducing Loops
-----------------
- Loops help execute code multiple times
    - In a more dynamic and flexible way


- In JavaScript, it has four main loops
    - for
        - Excecute code in a certain amount of time
        - With the help of a counter variable
        - Reference (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for)

        Syntax:

        for (initialization; exit_condition; afterthought/counter_variable)
            statement


    - for-of
        - Executes for every element in an array or an iterable
        - Reference (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for...of)

        Syntax:

        for (element_variable of iterable)
            statement


    - for-in 
        - Executes for every key in an object
        - Reference (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for...in)

        Syntax:

        for (key_variable in object)
            statement


    - while
        - Execute code as long as a condition remain true
        - Reference (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/while)
