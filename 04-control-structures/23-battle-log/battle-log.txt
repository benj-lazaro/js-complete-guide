Adding A Conditional Battle Log
-------------------------------
- Implement the log functionality as a separate function that
    - Records an event of each round of the game, stored in an array
        - Details of the log is viewable on the browser's console tab
        - Using an event handler (callback function)
    
    - Each element an object that contains data on
        - Event identifier
        - Damage cost, who won or heal value
        - Target (i.e. hard-coded string value of 'monster' or 'player' BUT non-existent at game over)
        - Current monster health
        - Current player health
    
    - Each event has a constant identifier
        - Assigned with their corresponding static value

    - Calls the function from w/in the following functions
        - "endRound()"
        - "attackMonster()"
        - "healPlayerHandler()"

    
- On the starter project
    - Open the file "assets/scripts/app.js"

    - Declare new global constant 'event identifiers' respectively named
        - "LOG_EVENT_PLAYER_ATTACK"         = "PLAYER_ATTACK"
        - "LOG_EVENT_PLAYER_STRONG_ATTACK"  = "PLAYER_STRONG_ATTACK"
        - "LOG_EVENT_MONSTER_ATTACK"        = "MONSTER_ATTACK"
        - "LOG_EVENT_PLAYER_HEAL"           = "PLAYER_HEAL"
        - "LOG_EVENT_GAME_OVER"             = "GAME_OVER"

    - Declare a new global variable named "battleLog"
        - Assign an empty array

    - Create a new function named "writeToLog()"
        - Define the following parameter variables
            - "event"           = event identifier
            - "value"           = damage cost, winner (monster or player) or heal value
            - "MonsterHealth"   = current monster health
            - "playerHealth"    = current player health

        - Declare a local variable named "logEntry"
            - Stores event information taken from the parameter values as an object
            
            - NOTE: Optionally assign the initial properties & values
                - Have the additional property added w/in respective "if" block statement

        - Implement "if" statements
            - Use the constant event identifier to identify values to assign into the object
        
        - Push the object stored in the local variable "logEvent" into the array "battleLog"

    - Hook up an event listener for the constant "logBtn"
        - Listen for a "click" event
        - Calls the event handler "printLogHandler()"

    - Create a new event handler function named "printLogHandler()"
        - Pass the value of the array "battleLog"
            - As an argument to the "console.log()"
    
    - In the function "endRound()"
        - Right after the value update for the global variable "currentPlayerHealth"

        - Call the function "writeToLog()" w/ the following argument values
            - 1st = LOG_EVENT_MONSTER_ATTACK
            - 2nd = playerDamage
            - 3rd = currentMonsterHealth
            - 4th = currentPlayerHealth

        - In the "if" statements block that identifies the player won the game

        - Call the function "writeToLog()" w/ the following argument values
            - 1st = LOG_EVENT_GAME_OVER
            - 2nd = "PLAYER WON"
            - 3rd = currentMonsterHealth
            - 4th = currentPlayerHealth

    - In the function "attackMonster()"
        - Declare a new local variable named "logEvent"

        - In the "if" statement where the player attacked w/ a normal attack
            - Assign the value "LOG_EVENT_PLAYER_ATTACK" to the variable "logEvent"

        - In the "if" statement where the player attacked w/ a strong attack
            - Assign the value "LOG_EVENT_PLAYER_STRONG_ATTACK" to the variable "logEvent"

        - Right after the value update for the global variable "currentMonsterHealth"

        - Call the function "writeToLog()" w/ the following argument values
            - 1st = logEvent
            - 2nd = damage
            - 3rd = currentMonsterHealth
            - 4th = currentPlayerHealth

    - In the function "healPlayerHandler()"
        - Right after the value update for the global variable "currentPlayerHealth"

        - Call the function "writeToLog()" w/ the following argument values
            - 1st = LOG_EVENT_PLAYER_HEAL
            - 2nd = healValue
            - 3rd = currentMonsterHealth
            - 4th = currentPlayerHealth        

    - Save the changes

    - Load / reload the browser
        - Test the log functionality
