Introducting The Ternary Operator
---------------------------------
- A Ternary operator is a special conditional expression that 
    - Takes three (3) operators
        - A condintional statement followed by a "?"
        - Then an expression if condition is truthy followed by a ":"
        - Then an expression if condition is falsy

    - NOTE: It can have nested conditions
        - Use it w/ caution
        - Can quickly lead to hard-to-read code


    Syntax:
    <conditional_statement> ? <truthy_expression> : <falsy_expression>;


- It addresses limitations of an "if" statement
    - An "if" statement does NOT return a value

    - It can NOT be used in an assignment statement
        - Wherein a condition expects to return a value
        - The returned value is then assigned to a variable


- A Ternary operator is ideal for
    - Short condintional statement wherein
        - Returned value will be assigned to a constant / variable

    - It is NOT strictly better than an "if" statement

    - Use an "if" statement when 
        - Working with complex conditions
        - Working w/ complex values
        - Working w/ deep nested ternary expression


- On the starter project
    - Open the file "assets/scripts/app.js"

    - On the function "attackMonster()"
        - Assign a ternary expression to both the local variables "maxDamage" & "logEvent"

        - Refactor both variables to become a constant since
            - The assigned value will NOT be updated w/in the closure

    - Save the changes

    - Load / reload the browser
        - Test the buttons "ATTACK" & "STRONG ATTACK"
