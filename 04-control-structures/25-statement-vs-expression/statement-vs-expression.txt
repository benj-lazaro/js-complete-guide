A Bit Of Theory: Statements VS Expressions
------------------------------------------
- An expression
    - Yields a value
    - Stores the value in a constant / variable
    - Often located at the right-side of the "=" operator
    - It is ALSO a statement

    Example:
    const maxDamage = mode === MODE_ATTACK ? ATTACK_VALUE : STRONG_ATTACK_VALUE;


- A statement
    - Does NOT yield a value
    - Can NOT be located at the right-side of the "=" operator

    Example:
    if (currentMonsterHealth <=0 && currentPlayerHealth > 0) {
        ...
    }
