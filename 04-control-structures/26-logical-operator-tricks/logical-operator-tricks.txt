Logical Operator "Tricks" & Shorthands
--------------------------------------
- Logical opeartor "!!"
    - Performs a boolean coercion that
        - Coerces a truthy or falsy value into a REAL boolean "true" or "false" value
        - Basically a Type Conversion trick
        
    - Common use case
        - Need to work on REAL boolean values
        - Confirm user-input provided a truthy value

    Example:
    const userInput = "";
    const isValidInput = !!userInput // Returns "true" userInput has a value; otherwise false


- Logical operator "||"
    - Used to assign a default value to a constant or variable

    - When used in an expression 
        - Located at the right-hand side of the "=" operator

    - JavaScript evaluates the 1st operand (value)
        - If truthy
            - Returns the operand w/o converting it into a real boolean value
            - Assigns it to a constant / variable
            - Ignores the 2nd operand

        - If falsy
            - Returns the 2nd operand instead
            - Assigns it to a constant / variable

    Example:
    const defaultUser = "Nameless"
    const userName = defaultUser || "Max"; // Assigns "Max" IF the defaultUser is falsy


- Logical operator "&&"
    - Used to assign the 2nd operand (value) but
        - ONLY if the 1st operand is truthy

    - When used in an expression 
        - Located at the right-hand side of the "=" operator

    - JavaScript evaluates the 1st operand
        - If truthy or boolean "true"
            - The 2nd operand is assigned to a constant / variable

        - If falsy or "false"
            - The 1st operand is assigned to a constant / variable
            - Boolean "false" if assigned as value to the 1st operand

    Example:
    const name = isLoggedIn && "Max"    // Assigns "Max" ONLY if isLoggedIn is truthy
                                        // Otherwise, isLoggedIn will be assigned


- NOTE: The "&&" and "||" operators do NOT generate a boolean value
    - When used to combine conditions w/in an expression
        - BOTH return a generated boolean value
        - Due to the evaluated condition, NOT by the operators themselves
