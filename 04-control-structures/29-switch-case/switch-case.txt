Working With "switch-case" Statement
------------------------------------
- The "switch" statement
    - Evaluates an expression that yields a value
        - Then matches the returned value against a series of "case" clauses

    - Executes the statement(s) of the 1st matching "case" clause
        - Until a "break" statement is encountered
        - Ignores succeeding "case" clauses

        - Failing to implement a "break" statement
            - The "switch" statement will execute the succeeding "case" clause as well

        - NOTE: The "break" statement terminates the execution of a "switch" statement

    - If NO match is found
        - Executes the statement(s) of the optional "default" clause

    - Reference (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/switch)


    Syntax:
    switch (<expression>) {
        case <match_clause_1>:
            // statement
            break;
        case <match_clause_n>:
            // statement
            break;
        [default:]
            // statement
    }

    
    - Common use case:
        - Codebase that have multiple (simple BUT strict) equality checks
            - Executes statement(s) based on the evaluated condition (or returned value)
            - NOTE: Checks for a single value yielded by the evaluated expression
            
        - Behind the scene
            - The "switch" statement uses the "===" operator for strict equality checks          

        - A replacement for multiple "if" & "else if" statements w/
            - Strict equality checks
            - Checking for multiple different values

        - For complex conditional expressions
            - Use an "if" statement instead


- On the starter project
    - Open the file "assets/scripts/app.js"

    - Refactor the function "writeToLog()"
        - Replace the "if" & "else if" statements w/ "switch-case"

        - On the "default" clause
            - Assign the local variable "logEntry" w/ an empty object
