Error Handling With try-catch
-----------------------------
- The try..catch statement is composed of
    - A try block
    - A catch block
    - A finally block

- The code in the try block is executed first
    - If it throws an exception
    - The code in the catch block will be executed

- The code in the finally block will ALWAYS be executed
    - Before control flow exits the entire construct

- Reference (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/try...catch)


Syntax:

try {
  tryStatements
} catch (exceptionVar) {
  catchStatements
} finally {
  finallyStatements
}


- Some errors can NOT be avoided beyound your control as a developer
    - User input errors
    - Network errors

    - The try..catch helps throw & catch errors gracefully
        - Recover from them if possible
