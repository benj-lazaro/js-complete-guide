Coding Exercise 07: for Loops
-----------------------------
- For this exercise
    - Create a for loop that runs 100 times
    
    - In every run, the pre-defined "callMe()" function should be executed
        - Therefore, by the end of the loop, "callMe()" should have been called 100 times.

    - Important: Put your loop code into the existing "solve()" function 
        - To ensure that the automatic solution checking works as intended
