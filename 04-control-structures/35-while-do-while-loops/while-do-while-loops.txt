The "while" & "do while" Loops
------------------------------
- The "while" loop
    - The condition is evaluated first BEFORE
        - Executing the statements w/in the loop block 

    - Executes the loop as long as the condition evaluates to "true"

    - Reference (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/while)

    - NOTE: A "while" loop can serve as a replacement for a "for" loop
        - Although they're kind of niche

    Syntax:
    while (<condition>) {
        // statement
    }

    Example:
    let j = 0;
    while (j < 3) {
        console.log("----------");
        j++;
    }


- The "do while" loop
    - The condition is evaluated first AFTER
        - Executing the statements once w/in the loop block 

    - Executes the loop as long as the condition evaluates to "false"

    - Reference (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/do...while)

    Syntax:
    do {
        // statement
    } while (<condition>);

    Example:
    let randomNumbers = [];
    let finished = false;

    while(!finished) {
        const randomNumber = Math.random();
        randomNumbers.push(randomNumber);

        if (randomNumber > 0.5) {
            finished = true;
            console.log(randomNumbers)
        }
    }
