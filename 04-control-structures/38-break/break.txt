Controlling Loops With "break"
------------------------------
- The "break" statement
    - Terminates the current loop (as well as a "switch" statement)
        - Earlier than intended
        - Think of it as a "cancel" loop execution

    - If placed w/in a nested "for" loop
        - It terminates the inner "for" loop
        - Continues the execution of the outer "for" loop

    - Reference (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/break)


    Syntax:
    break;


- On the starter project
    - Open the file "assets/scripts/app.js"

    - Declare a new global variable named "lastLoggedEntry"
        - Leave it undefined

    - In the event handler function "printLogHandler()"
        - In the "for..of" loop

        - Declare a new "if" statement
            - Check if the global variable "lastLoggedEntry" is set AND
                - NOT equal to 0
                - OR the assigned value to "lastLoggedEntry" less than
                    - The assigned value of the local variable "i"

            - If truthy
                - Use the "for..of" loop to print the key-value pairs
                    - Of the objects stored in the global variable "battleLog"

                - Assign the value of the local variable "i"
                    - To the global variable "lastLoggedEntry"

                - Insert a "break" statement

            - Increment the value of the local variable "i"
                - At the end of the "if" statement

    - Save the changes

    - Load / reload the browser
        - Test the modified behavior of the button "SHOW LOG"
