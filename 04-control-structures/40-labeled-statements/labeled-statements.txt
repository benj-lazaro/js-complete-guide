More Control With Labeled Statements
------------------------------------
- A labeled statement
    - Refers to any statement prefixed with an identifier (i.e. label)
    
    - Commonly used on nested loops
        - Placing identifiers in front of an outer & inner loop
        
        - Using "break" & "continue" statements to respectively
            - Break the entire loop execution
            - Skip the current loop iteration 

    - NOTE: It is a nice-to-know feature but RARELY needed

    - Reference (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/label)

    Syntax:
    <label>: <loop>;
    <label>: <expression>;


    - Common use case
        - Terminates the entire execution of nested loops
            - From a condition defined w/in an inner loop

            - Using a "break" statement (e.g. break <label>)
                - To jump to the outer loop's identifier
                - Effectively terminates the entire loop execution


        - Skips the current iteration of the outer loop
            - From a condition defined w/in an inner loop

            - Using a "continue" statement (e.g. continue <label>)
                - To jump to the outer loop's identifier
                - Effectively skips the current iteration of the outer loop

            - NOTE: Be mindful of the condition required to terminate the loop
                - This has the potential to become an infinite loop
