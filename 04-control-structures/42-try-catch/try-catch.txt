Error Handling With "try..catch": An Introduction
-------------------------------------------------
- A "try..catch" statement
    - A control structure that throws & catch errors gracefully
        - Recover from these errors w/ a corresponding fallback code

    - It is composed of a "try", "catch" & "finally" blocks wherein
        - The statement(s) w/in the "try" block is executed

        - If an error is thrown, the "catch" block will be executed
            - To execute some fallback code

        - The statement(s) w/in the "finally" block will
            - ALWAYS be executed before the "try..catch" terminates

    - Reference (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/try...catch)


    Syntax:
    try {
        // statement
    } catch (<exception>) {
        // statement
    } finally {
        // statement
    }
