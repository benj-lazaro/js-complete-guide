ES5 VS ES6+ (Next Gen JS): Evolution of JavaScript
--------------------------------------------------
- ECMAScript (ES) is the language behind JavaScript
    - It is the language being standardized by the ECMA International
    - It is under Active Development

    - ECMA International
        - Responsible for working new interations of ECMAScript
        - Browser developers adopt these iterations into their JavaScript Engines


- JavaScript evolution
    - ES5
        - The (major) released standard that 
            - Was agreed & adopted by browser developers
        
        - Supported by ALL browsers (including the old Internet Explorer)

        - Only supports the keyword "var" for creating variables
            - NO support for keyword "let" & "const"

        - Generally has the same syntax as ES6
            - But missing some features


    - ES6 (& newer release)
        - Considered as the Modern JavaScript

        - Recent ECMAScript standard was finished in 2015
            - Dubbed as ECMAScript 2015 & also referred as ES6

        - Supported by modern browsers
            - JavaScript code can (mostly) be transpiled to ES5
        
        - Incremental updates implement through browsers' auto-update feature
            - Ensures the latest JavaScript updates

        - Offer features that
            - Write better, cleaner & faster code

        - Still under Active Development
