--------------------------------------------------
- ES stands for ECMAScript
    - It is the language behind JavaScript 
    - It is the language being standardize by ECMA International
    - It is under active development

    - ECMA International 
        - They are responsible on working new iterations of ECMAScript (JavaScript)
        - Browser developers adopt these iterations into their respective JavaScript Engines


- JavaScript Evolution
    - Dates back into the 90s

    - ES5 
        - It was the released standard that was agreed and adopted by browser developers

            - Modern browsers' auto update feature ensures the latest JavaScript updates
                - Incremental updates on their respective JavaScript Engines

            - It mostly can transpile ES6 code into ES5 for older browser support

        - Offer new features that help write better, clearner & faster code

        - It is still under active development
            - ES6 was a milestrong moving forward
