var VS let & const: Introducing Block Scope
-------------------------------------------
- The keyword "var"
    - Creates a variable that is of Function & Global scoped
        - Introduced since the creation of JavaScript

    - Allows the declaration of the same variable name w/in the same scope
        - It does NOT trigger an "Uncaught SyntaxError"

    - Accessing the variable outside of its declared scope
        - It triggers an "Uncaught ReferenceError"
    
    - NOTE: Discouraged of the use of "var" in modern JavaScript
        - It ONLY exists for backward compatibility w/ older browsers
