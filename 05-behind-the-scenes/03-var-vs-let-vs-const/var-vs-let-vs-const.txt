var VS let VS const: Introducing The Block Scope
------------------------------------------------
- The keyword "var" defines a variable
    - Made available since the beginning of the JavaScript language
    - Declares a variable to be a function and globally scoped
    - Reference (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/var)

    - It is possible to redeclare a variable within the same scope 
        - This will NOT trigger a "SyntaxError"
        - Which meant that a variable of the same name had already been declared

    - On modern JavaScript, it is DISCOURAGED to use "var"
        - It ONLY exists for backward compatibility with older borwsers

- The keyword "const" defines a constant variable
    - Made available since ES6
    - Declares a constant variable to be blocked scoped
