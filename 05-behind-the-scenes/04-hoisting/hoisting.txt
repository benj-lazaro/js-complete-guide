Understanding Hoisting
----------------------
- Hosting is a special feature of the JavaScript Engine
    - It "hoists" variable(s) at the beginning of the file 
        - Leaves the declaration (& initializtion) at the respective locations w/in the codebase

    - This applies to variables created w/ the keyword "let" or "var"

    - Reference (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Hoisting)


- Accessing a variable created w/ "var" BEFORE it is declared (& initialized)
    - Returns an "undefined" value

    - Leads to a codebase that is hard to understand
        - Requires digging through lines of code during debugging


- Accessing a variable created w/ "let" BEFORE it is declared (& initialized)
    - Triggers an "Uncaught ReferenceError: Cannot access '<variable_name>' before initializtion"

    - Forces developers to declare a variable BEFORE using it
