Understanding Hoisting
----------------------
- Hoisting refers to the process whereby the JavaScript interpreter
    - Appears to have "moved" the declaration of:
        - classes
        - imports
        - variables

        - At the top of their corresponding scope PRIOR to the execution of the code

    - Reference (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Hoisting)


- Accessing a variable created using the keyword "let" BEFORE it is declared
    - Returns a "ReferenceError: Cannot access before initialization"

    - Behind the scenes, JavaScript hoists the variable to the top of its scope
        - Then access the variable which at this point undeclared
        - Triggers the "ReferenceError: Cannot access before initialization"


- Accessing a variable created using the keyword "var" BEFORE it is declared
    - Returns an "undefined" value

    - Behind the scenes, JavaScript hoists the variable to the top of its scope
        - Then access the variable prior to the assignment of its initial value
        - Returns a value of "undefined"


- It is ENCOURAGED to declare a variable BEFORE using it
    - Regardless on whether "let" or "var is used
