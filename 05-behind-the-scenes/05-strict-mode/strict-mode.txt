Strict Mode & Writing Good Code
-------------------------------
- Strict Mode
    - Enables a restricted variant of JavaScript
        - Introduced in ES5
        - Implements best coding practices
    
    - NOTE: ES6 mimics most of the behavior enabled by Strict Mode
    - Reference (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Strict_mode)


- To enable Strict Mode
    - At the top of the file, declare the following statement

        "use strict";

        - Enables the Strict Mode for the content of this specific file ONLY

    - The Strict Mode can also be declared w/in a function
        - This enables Strict Mode ONLY w/in the function's closure

    - BOTH Strict & Non-Strict Modes can co-exists
        - Codebase can opt into Strict Mode incrementally


- When Strict Mode is enabled
    - Declaring a variable w/o using either "let" or "var" keyword
        - Triggers an "Uncaught ReferenceError: <variable> is not defined"

    - Declaring a reserved word as a variable name using the keyword "let"
        - Triggers an "Uncaught SyntaxError"
        - NOTE: Returned error message is dependent on the reserved word used

    - Declaring a reserved word as a variable name using the keyword "let" or "var"
        - Triggers an "Uncaught TypeErrpr"
        - NOTE: Returned error message is dependent on the reserved word used
        
    - List of behavioral changes when in Strict Mode
        - Reference (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Strict_mode#changes_in_strict_mode)


- When Strict Mode is disabled
    - Variable declartion (before using it) is NOT REQUIRED
        - Declaring a variable w/o using either "let" or "var" keywords
        - Behind the scene, JavaScript defaults using the keyword "var"

    - Using a reserved word to declare a variable is NOT prohibited
        - When using the keyword "var"
            - When the variable is accessed
            - Often returns an "undefined" value

        - It does NOT trigger an error
