Strict Mode & Writing Good Code
-------------------------------
- Strict Mode is a way to enable a "restricted variant" of JavaScript
    - Introduced in ES5
    - It implicitly opts out "sloppy mode" or Non-Strict Mode


- To enable Strict Mode 
    - At the very start of the code, type the string

        "use strict"

    - Strict Mode can also be declared within a function
        - Resulting to Strict Mode enabled ONLY within that particular function

    - Both Strict Mode & Non-Strict Mode codebase can coexists
        - Code can opt into Strict Mode incrementally

    - Enabling Strict Mode is optional
        - Better implement best coding practices
        - Modern JavaScript "mimics" most of the Strict Mode behavior

    - Reference (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Strict_mode)


- When Strict Mode is enabled
    - Variable declaration is REQUIRED
        - Using either "let" or "var"
        - Otherwise, returns a "ReferenceError: Cannot access before initialization"

    - Prohibits the use of a Reserved Name when declaring a variable
        - Using "var" returns a "TypeError"
        - JavaScript can NOT assign a value to a READ-ONLY property of the <window> object

        - Using "let" returns a "SyntaxError"
        - JavaScript can NOT use the Reserved Name as it had already been declared

        - Reference (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Strict_mode#changes_in_strict_mode)

    
- Whe in Non-Strict Mode
    - Variable declaration is NOT enforced
        - Behind the scenes, JavaScript uses the "var"

    - Reserved Names / Words can be used as a variable name using "var" 
        - Often returns an "undefined" value
            - Depending on the Reserved Name used

        - JavaScript does NOT trigger an error
