How Code Is Parsed & Compiled
-----------------------------
- The browser loads and parses through an HTML document
    - Sees and loads the imported JavaScript code
    
    - Then browser execute each line of JavaScript code from top to bottom
        - Details on its execution is heavily dependent on the browser's JavaScript Engine
            - Chrome    = v8 Chrome (https://hackernoon.com/javascript-v8-engine-explained-3f940148d4ef)
            - firefox   = SpiderMonkey (https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/js/index.html)

    - The JavaScript Engine interpreter
        - Loads, reads and parses the JavaScript code
        - Translates it into bytecode
        - Runs the bytecode line-by-line in an optimized way

    - The interpreter hands over the bytecode to the Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler
        - To translate bytecode into machine code

        - The JIT compiler starts compiling AND executing the compiled code
            - Whilst the remainder of the bytecode is being translated 

    - The JIT compiler then hands over the machine code to the browser's Host OS
        - To execute the machine code


- The JavaScript Engine applies optimization techniques
    - To speed up compilation and execution time

    - JavaScript code that is NOT modified between the recent & current execution
        - Is NOT necessarily re-compiled
        - Previous compiled code is re-used

    - The browser offer features in the for of APIs
        - Serves as a communication bridge between the browser's APIs & JavaScript
        - Browser's APIs / features are often implemented in C++
        - Access to these APIs can be bundled into the compiled machine code
