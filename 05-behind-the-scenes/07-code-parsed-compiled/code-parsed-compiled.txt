How Code Is Parsed & Compiled
-----------------------------
- When the browser loads & reads through an HTML document
    - It detects the linked external JavaScript file
    - Parses (reads) through the JavaScript code & then executes it
    
    - The exact details on what the browser does with 
        - The JavaScript code is dependent on a brower's JavaScript Engine
            - V8 Engine     = Chome, Brave, Edge, Opera
                - Reference (https://hackernoon.com/javascript-v8-engine-explained-3f940148d4ef)

            - Spidermonkey  = Firefox
                - Reference (https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/js/index.html)


- The following is how the V8 Engine generally works w/ the JavaScript code
    - Two (2) of its components are involved
        - Interpreter
        - JIT (Just-In-Time) compiler (called TurboFan)

    - The Interpreter loads, reads & translates (each line of code) into bytecode
        - Starts executing the bytecode
        - Concurrently, hands over the bytecode to the JIT compiler

    - The JIT compiler compiles the bytecode into machine code
        - Compiled machine code is handed over to the browser for execution


- The browser's JavaScript Engine applies a couple of optimization techniques
    - To speed up the compilation & execution time

    - JavaScript code that did NOT change between the last & current execution
        - Is NOT necessarily re-compiled into machine code again
        - Instead re-uses the recently compiled machine code

    - Browser APIs serves as "communication bridges"
        - Between JavaScript & the C++ logic built into the browser
        
        - Offer features that allows JavaScript to work with the
            - Loaded HTML document
            - User's (geographical) location
    
        - These come in the form of functions or objects
            - Bundled w/ the compiled machine code
