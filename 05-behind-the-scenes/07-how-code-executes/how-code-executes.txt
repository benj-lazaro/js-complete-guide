Inside The JavaScript Engine: How The Code Executes
---------------------------------------------------
- Steps on how the JavaScript Engine executes the JavaScript code
    - Inside the JavaScript Engine are two important concepts
        - Heap
        - Stack


- Heap is responsible for memory allocation
    - Think of it as a Long Term memory
    
    - It stores data in system memory used by the JavaScript code
        - The browser taps into the Host OS's system memory
        - Host OS allocates the corresponding "heap memory" for the browser

    - It manages access of data to and from the "heap memory"

    - All declared functions are stored in the "heap memory"


- Stack is responsible in the executon context of the JavaScript code
    - Think of it as a Short Term memory    

    - It manages the JavaScript code's program flow
        - Monitors which function is currently executing
        - To which function it returns data

    - When the JavaScript code is run, the stack becomes active
        - It pushes anonymous code into the stack
            - Anonymous function(s) get pushed into the stack first

        - Each function call is pushed into the stack
            - The top-most item in the stack points to the function currently executing

            - When a function is done or NOT required anymore
                - It gets popped off from the stack
                - BUT remains stored in "heap memory"

        - Once the entire JavaScript code is done
            - The anonymous function get popped off from the stack 

    - The "stack memory" can be viewed using Chrome's Dev Tools
        - Click "Sources" tab
        - Choose a function with a "return" statement
        - Place a breakpoint on that line of code
        - Reload the HTML document
        - Look at the "Call Stack" tab
            - A list of function names in the stack are displayed


- JavaScript is single-threaded
    - This means that the JavaScript can ONLY do ONE THING at a time
    - It calls one function at a time
        - The remaining functions wait for a response from the function currently executing


- Event Loop
    - This is NOT part of the JavaScript Engine BUT of modern browsers

    - It helps with asynchronous code
        - With things like Event Listeners 

    - Pass Events to the browser
        - It does NOT involve the participation of the JavaScript Engine

    - The browser manages defined Event Listeners
        - Pushes the associated callback function of an Event into the stack
        - When an Event occurs, it calls the corresponding callback function
        - Then pops it off the stack after completing its task
