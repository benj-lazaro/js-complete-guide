Inside The JavaScript Engine: How The Code Executes
---------------------------------------------------
- The JavaScript Engine in the end is all about
    - Managing memory (heap)
    - Manaing execution steps (stack)


- Heap
    - It is the long-term memory
        - It is all about memory allocation
        - It stores data in the system memory & manages access to it

    - The browser taps into the host computer's system memory
        - The host computer allocates memory for use of the browser application
        - This allocated memory is called a "Heap"

    - This is where the (long-term) data that 
        - The JavaScript code works with get stored


- Stack
    - Think of it as short-term memory (or data structure)
        - It is all about for the execution of the JavaScript code
        - It is where the JavaScript Engine keeps track on what is currently happening
        
    - JavaScript Engine keeps track on what is currently happening
        - By pushing new function calls (or short-living data) on top of the Stack
        - Popping it off when it is NOT required anymore

    - When the JavaScript code execution starts
        - It pushes the "anonymous" function on the Stack
            - NOTE: "anonymous" function basically the JavaScript code as an unnamed function

        - Each succeeding function call is pushed on the top of the Stack
            - NOTE: Top-most item of the Stack is ALWAYS the function that is currently executing
        
        - When a function completes its task
            - It is popped off from the Stack
            - NOTE: Does NOT mean that the corresponding function definition is removed from the Heap

        - When the JavaScript code completes its task
            - The "anonymous" function gets popped off from the Stack

    - To visually view the content of the Stack
        - Launch Chrome Dev Tools

        - Click the tab "Sources"

        - On the tab "Page"
            - Select the (currently running) JavaScript file

        - On the JavaScript code (in the tab "Sources")
            - Select a function w/ a "return" statement
            - Place a breakpoint on that line of code
        
        - Reload the browser

        - Expand the tab "Call Stack"
            - Lists functions inside the Stack

    - NOTE: JavaScript is single-threaded
        - This basically means that it can "only do one thing at a time"
        
        - JavaScript Engine can ONLY call one (1) function at a time
            - Other functions wait for the completion of the current executing function


- Event Loop
    - It is NOT part of the JavaScript Engine but of modern browsers
        - Helps work w/ asynchronous code (e.g.  Event Listeners)

        - JavaScript Engine does NOT care about ongoing Event Listeners

    - Browser "pings" the JavaScript Engine when
        - A new event is being fired by the JavaScript code' Event Listeners
