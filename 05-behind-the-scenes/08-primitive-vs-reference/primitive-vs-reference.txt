Primitive VS Reference Values
-----------------------------
- JavaScript has two categories of data types
    - Primitive
    - Reference


- Primitive data type
    - Refers to a value that is NOT an object
    
    - It has NO method or property BUT behavies as it is has
    
    - It is stored in memory, generally in the stack
        - It is a short-lived value 
        
    - It is cheap to re-create or duplicate
        - It consumes less memory
        - Therefore it is "cheap"

    - The browser decides where to store the value
        - heap or stack
        
    - When assigned to a variable
        - The actual value is stored

    - When a variable assigned with a primitive value is copied to another variable
        - JavaScript creates a copy of the value to the latter variable
        - It is COPIED by VALUE

        - When the former variable changes its primitive value
            - The change is NOT reflected on the latter variable

    - JavaScript has 7 Primitive data types
        - string    = dynamically transformed into a pseudo object
        - number    = dynamically transformed into a pseudo object
        - bitint
        - boolean
        - undefined
        - symbol
        - null


- Reference data type
    - Refers to all values that are objects

    - It is stored in heap memory

    - It is expense to re-create or duplicate
        - As it consumes more memory

    - When assigned to a variable
        - The memory address of the actual value is store
        - Instead of the actual value

    - When a variable assigned with a reference value is copied to another variable
        - JavaScript assigns the same memory address to the latter variable
        - It is COPIED by REFERENCE

        - When the former variable changes its primitive value
            - The change is REFLECTED on the latter variable
        
    - To create a duplicate copy of a reference value (e.g. object)
        - Requires the use of the spread operator (...) followed by the name of the object being copied
        - It copies the object's properties into the new object
        - Reference (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_syntax)

    - Comparing variables with two identical reference values using the === operator
        - Yields a boolean value of "false"

        - Each variable store the memory location of the assigned value
            - NOT their actual values
            - Each value is stored at different memory locations

        - The === operator compares the different memory locations
            - Resulting to a boolean value of "false"


- To add a new element or value to a constant variable with a reference value
    - If the reference value is an array
        - Use the .push() method

    - If the reference value is an object
        - Simply assign the updated value to the object's property

    - Either method will NOT generate an error
        - Despite a constant variable can NOT change its initial value

        - The constant variable stores the memory address of the reference value
            - This memory address NEVER changes
            - Despite the changes / updates made on the actual value stored in said memory address

    - However, directly assigning a new reference value to a declared constant variable
        - Generates a "TypeError: Assignment to constant variable"
        - This is due to replacing the existing memory address
