Deep Dive: JavaScript Language VS Browser APIs
----------------------------------------------
- JavaScript language
    - Understand core syntax (e.g. let, const, etc.)
        - Does NOT know anything about the DOM (Document Object Model)

    - It is advanced by the ECMA International Technical Committee 39 (TC39)
        - A group responsible for adding new features to the JavaScript itself
        - Reference (https://tc39.es/)

    - Just because a new feature becomes part of the JavaScript language
        - Does NOT mean ALL JavaScript Engines IMMEDIATELY support it


- Browser APIs
    - NOT responsible for understanding what the code does
        - Responsible for exposing APIs (e.g. DOM) w/c can be used w/in a JavaScript code

    - APIs are also standardized & handled by the WHATWG community
        - NOTE: This community is NOT related to TC39
        - Reference (https://whatwg.org/)
