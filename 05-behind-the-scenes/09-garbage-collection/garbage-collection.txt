Garbage Collection & Memory Management
--------------------------------------
- How does the browser manage the heap (long-term memory)
    - Host OS allocates a certain amount of memory for the browser
    - Excess allocation of memory would kill the web app (if not the browser)
     

- Memory management is handled by the Garbage Collector 
    - Every JavaScript Engine has one

    - Garbage Collector periodically checks the heap
        - For unused objects (objects without references)
        - Removes the unused objects

    - Chrome V8 Garbage Collection Logic
        - Reference (https://v8.dev/blog/free-garbage-collection)


    - Modern browser automatically activate the Garbage Collector
        - Removing the need to manually assing null to a variable
            - That once held a reference value
        
        - Variables that are no longer used anywhere in the script
            - Will automatically be removed by the Garbage Collector
        
        - Garbage collection is an automatic event
            - It can NOT be invoked manually


- Be aware of memory leaks
    - Memory leaks refers to unused objects BUT you still hold references to
