Primitive VS Reference Values
------------------------------
- JavaScript has two (2) categories of values
    - Primitive
    - Reference


- Primitive values
    - Refers to the value of the following data types
        - Strings, Numbers, Booleans, null, undefined & Symbol

    - The variable stores the actualy value itself

    - Stored (generally) on the Stack
        - These are short-living values
        - JavaScript gets rid of them relatively easily
        - NOTE: The browser decides w/c memory to store primitive values

    - They are cheap to re-create & duplicate
        - Does NOT cost much memory

    - Copying a primitive value between two (2) variables using the operator "="
        - JavaScript copies the actual value to the recepient variable
            - This is referred as "copied by value"
    
        - When the source variable change its stored primitive value
            - The recepient variables does NOT REFLECT the change 


- Reference values
    - Refers to the value of the following data types
        - All JavaScript (real) objects (e.g. array, object)

        - NOTE: Strings & Numbers are technically "pseudo-objects"
            - JavaScript transforms these primitive values into an object that
            - Grants them object-like properties & methods

    - Stored on the Heap 
        - NOTE: The browser decides w/c memory to store reference values

    - They are expensive to re-create & duplicate
        - Consumes more memory
        - Complex to manage
        - Creating takes longer

    - The variable (or constant) stores a reference to the value (real object) stored in Heap memory
        - Instead of the actual value itself

    - Copying a reference value between two (2) variables using the operator "="
        - JavaScript assigns (NOT copies) the exact reference (memory address) to the recepient variable
            - This is referred as "copied by reference"
    
        - When the source variable changes (or updates) its stored reference value 
            - The recepient variables REFLECT the changes made

    - To copy the actual value of a reference value between two (2) variables
        - Use the spead operator "..." followed by the variable
            - Enclosed w/in the pair of "{ }" or  "[ ]"

        - It pulls out the elements (if an array) or properties (if an object)
            - Creates a real copy of the value (NOT the memory address) into the recepient variable

    - When comparing between two (2) identical reference values using the "===" or "==" operator
        - Will ALWAYS yield a boolean "false"
        
        - Due to pointers (NOT the actual) value are being compared
            - Their respective reference (memory address) will ALWAYS be different

    - Storing a reference value in a constant & then updating the value
        - Does NOT generate an error
        
        - Due to the pointer (NOT the actual) value that remains UNCHANGED
            - The update is sent to the same pointer (memory address)
        
        - Assigning a new array or object into the same constant 
            - Triggers an "Uncaught TypeError: Assignment to constant variable"
            - This is an attempt to replace the existing pointer stored in the constant
