Garbage Collection & Memory Management
--------------------------------------
- How the brower manages the Heap (long-living memory)
    - Browser taps the host computer's system memory
        - Host computer allocates a certain amount of memory for use of the browser
    
    - Excess allocation of Heap results to an overflow that
        - Either terminates a web application or possibly the browser itself

    - Reference (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Memory_management)


- Memory management is handled by the JavaScript Engine's Garbage Collector
    - It periodically checks the Heap
        - For unused objects
            - (i.e. objects w/o a reference or pointer to an actual value stored in Heap)
    
    - Then removes ALL unused objects from the Heap


- Modern browsers automatically activates its Garbage Collector
    - It is an automatic event
        - It can NOT be triggered manually or by human-intervention

    - Constants and/or variables that are NO longer used anywhere in the script
        - They are automatically removed from Heap

    - Chrome's V8 Engine's Garbage Collection Logic
        - Reference (https://v8.dev/blog/free-garbage-collection)

    - NOTE: Be mindful of memory leaks
        - An object that is NOT used anymore anywhere w/in the codebase
            - BUT still holds reference to it

        - Garbage Collection will NOT be able to remove it
            - Introduces a bug in the codebase
            - Due to the allocation of memory that is NOT used & may lead to an overflow
    

- In the example (app.js)
    - Copy the body of the function "printMessage()"

    - In the function "addListener()"
        - Replace the callback function name "printMessage"
            - Paste the codebase
            - Remove the name, effectively making it an Anonymous function

        - Every click of the HTML element <button> w/ an attribute "id" of "addListenerBtn"
            - It calls the Anonymous callback function

            - However, unliked the named callback function
                - Every click, creates a new function on-the-fly
                - Allocating memory for each instance
                - This is a potential problem that can lead to a memory leak

        - Using the named callback function
            - Once the function is registered when the JavaScript code is parsed
            - It ONLY allocates memory once
            - The same named callback function is used for every click
