Recapping Functions: What We Know Thus Far
------------------------------------------
- A quick recap on functions
    - A function is a construct that defines "code on demand"


- When the browser's JavaScript Engine reads a JavaScript file
    - It goes through the entire code from top to bottom

    - Finds & then registers ALL declared functions
        - Grants the ability to be called & executed as often as needed
        - Called from anywhere in the codebase

    - Then starts executing the code line-by-line


- The constants and/or variables declared w/in a function
    - Belongs to that function ONLY (i.e. Block Scope)


- A function can
    - Optionally take parameters (arguments) & return a value
    
    - Be called directly
        - By its function name followed by a pair of "( )"
        - This IMMEDIATELY EXECUTES the function

    - Be called indirectly
        - Attaching the function name to another function
            - Without the suceeding pair of "( )"
            - (e.g. event handler functions)
            - This PREVENTS the IMMEDIATE EXECUTION of the function
        
        - It ONLY EXECUTES when
            - The other function where it is called from gets executed
            - The corresponding Event is triggered
