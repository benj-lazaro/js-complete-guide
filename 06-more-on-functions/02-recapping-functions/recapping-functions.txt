Recapping Functions Knowledge: What We Know Thus Far
----------------------------------------------------
- Functions are constructs that define "code on-demand"
    - When JavaScript reads a JavaScript file
        - It goes through the entire code first
        
        - Find all function declarations
            - Registers them       
            
            - Functions can be called as often as needed
                - Executed multiple times
                - From different places in the code
        
        - Starts executing the script


- Defined constants and variables within a function
    - They belong to that function (i.e. Block Scope)


- A function can take parameters (arguments) and return a value
    - Optionally can take parameters
    - Optionally can return a value


- A function can be called multiple
    - Each call with different argument value(s)
    - Producting different results for different calls


- A function can be called directly and/or indirectly
    - Directly by calling a function by its name
    - Followed by a pair of ( )

    - Indirectly by binding a function's name to another function (e.g. Event Listner)
    - Without the suceeding pair of ( )
        - This prevents a function from being executed immediately
        - ONLY called when the corresponding function / event is triggered
