Recapping Functions Knowledge: What We Know Thus Far
----------------------------------------------------
- Functions are "code on demand"
    - When JavaScript read the code/script
        - It goes through the entire code first
        - Finds all function declarations & register each of them
        - Start executing the code
        - Declared function(s) can then be called as often as needed
            - From different places in the code


- Constants and variables created within a function
    - Belongs to that function = block scope


- Functions can take any number of parameters / arguments and can return a value


- Functions can be called multiple times
    - Each with different arguments


- Functions can be called directly and indirectly
    - Directly by calling the function by its name followed by ( )
        - Executes the function immediately

    - Indirectly binding the function name without ( ); often binded to an event listener
        - Prevents the function from executing immediately
        - Calls the function when the corresponding event is triggered
