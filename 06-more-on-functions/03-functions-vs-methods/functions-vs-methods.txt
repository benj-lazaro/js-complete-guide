Functions VS Methods
--------------------
- A function is one of the fundamental building blocks in JavaScript
    - Reference (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Functions)


- A function can be stored as a property of an object
    - The function will now be referred to as a "method"

    - It is simply a function attached to an object

        const person = {
            name: "Max",
            greet: function greet() {           // Function inside an object (i.e. method)
                console.log("Hello there!");
            },
        };


- The method ".addEventListener()" is attached to the an object that
    - 1st argument value    = Listens to the declared event
    - 2nd argument value    = Executes corresponding function when the event occurs

        startGameBtn.addEventListener("click", startGame);
