Functions Are Objects
---------------------
- To prove that a function is an object
    - Pass the name of a user-defined function without the ( ) as argument to console.dir()

    - Returns a list of key-value pairs (properties) associated to the function
        - Similar to that of a JavaScript object

    - Function is a JavaScript object with pre-configured properties
        - Stored in Heap memory
        - It is a reference type of value


- The console.dir() is a static method that returns a list of properties
    - Of the specified / passed JavaScript object
