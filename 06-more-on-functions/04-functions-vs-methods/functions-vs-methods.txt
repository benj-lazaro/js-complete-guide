Functions VS Methods
--------------------
- A Function is one of the fundamental building blocks in JavaScript
    - Reference (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Functions)


- When a function is stored as a value of an Object's property
    - The property (where the function stored as value) is now referred as a "Method"
    - It is nothing else but a Function attached to an Object

    Example:
    const person = {
        name: "Max",
        greet: function greet() {
            console.log("Hello there");
        }
    };

    - To execute an Object's Method
        - Declare the Object name 
        - Followed by a "."
        - Then the Method name w/ a pair of "( )"

        <object_name>.<property_name>();

    Exanple:
    person.greet(); // Calls the "person" object's "greet()" method


- In the starting code
    - The constant "startGameBtn" is assigned w/ an object named "document"
        - NOTE: The "document" object provides access
            - To the elements of the HTML document 
            - Where the JavaScript file is attached to

    - Attach the method ".getElementById()" to the "document" object
        - NOTE: The method targets a specific HTML element
            - By the assigned value of its HTML attribute "id"

    - Define a normal function named "startGame()"
        - Calls "console.log()"
        - Passing the string "Game is starting..." as argument value

    - Define an Event handler
        - Declare the object "startGameBtn"
            - NOTE: The same constant assigned w/ the "document" object

        - Attach the method ".addEventListener()" to the object "startGameBtn"
            - Requires two (2) argument values
                - 1st argument: Event to listen to
                - 2nd argument: Callback function w/o the pair of "( )"

            - Pass the argument values
                - 1st argument: "click"
                - 2nd argument: "startGame"

        startGameBtn. addEventListener("click", startGame);
    
    - Save the changes

    - Load / reload the browser
        - Launch the Chrome Dev Tools

        - Click the button "Start Game!"

        - The message "Game is starting..." is prompted
            - On the browser's "Console" tab
