Function Expression: Storing Functions In Variables
---------------------------------------------------
- The keyword function can be used to define a function inside an expression
    - Reference (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/function)


- A function object assigned to variable or constant
    - Losses its global scope coverage
    - Becomes a local scope within the assigned variable / constant name


- A function expression assigns a function object into a constant or variable
    - The function losses its global scope coverage
    - Becomes a local scope within the constant / variable

    - The name of the function is typically omitted (making it an anonymous function)
        - Since it can NOT be referenced anymore by name in the Global scope
        - It can ONLY be access through the name of constant or variable name it is assigned to
