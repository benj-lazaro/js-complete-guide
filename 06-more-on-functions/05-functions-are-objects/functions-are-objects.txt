Functions Are Objects
---------------------
- A Function is a special type of an Object
    - It comes with pre-configured properties
    - Typically stored in the Heap
    - Like an Object, it is a Reference type value


- To prove that Function is an Object
    - Define a function

    - Pass the function name w/o the pair of "( )"
        - As an argument value to "console.dir()"

    - Returns a list of key-value pairs (i.e. properties)
        - Similar to that of an Object
