Function Expression: Storing Functions In Variables
---------------------------------------------------
- The keyword "function"
    - Can also be used to define a Function w/in an expression
    - Reference (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/function)


- A function expression refers to
    - The assignment of a Function object to a constant or variable 

    - Doing so, the Function object losses its Global Scope coverage
        - Making it a Local Scope w/in the constant or variable

        - Attempt to access by its name directly
            - Triggers an "Uncaught ReferenceError: <function> not defined"

    - The name of the Function object is (typically) OMITTED
        - Making it an "Anonymous Function"
            - As it can NOT be referenced anymore by its name
        
        - Accessed ONLY by referencing the constant or variable name 
            - It is assigned (or belongs) to


- In the starting code
    - Declare a constant named "start"
        - Assign an Anonymous function as value
        - NOTE: This is referred as a "Function expression"

    - The Anonymous function
        - Passes the string "Game is starting..." as argument value
            - To the "console.log()"

    - Delete the function "startGame()"

    - In the Event handler for the object "startGameBtn"
        - Refactor the callback function "startGame" to "start"

    - Save the changes

    - Load / reload the browser
        - Click the "Start Game!" button
        - It should work as it was prior to the refactor of its code
