Anonymous Functions
-------------------
- An anonymous function is a function without a name
    - Commonly used in a function expression
        - Wherein the name of the constant / variable
        - Is the name by which the function is called / referenced


    - Defined in placed as a callback function for an Event Listener
        - When the anonymous function has NO other place in the entire code where
            - It will be called again besides the associated event


- Why assign a name to an anonymous function
    - When an anonymous function encounters an error
        - Browser triggers an error BUT it does NOT provide the name of the associated function
        - Due to being an anonymous function without a defined name
            - Although a line number where the error is captured will be reported
            - Will pose an problem if the code base is huge

    - A declared function however returns the associated function name that triggered an error

    - Use case of assigning a name to an anonymous function is for debugging
        - To help identify the anonymous function that triggered the error

        - NOTE: This is NOT necessary since the browser throws the line number where the error is located
            - But a good option to have
