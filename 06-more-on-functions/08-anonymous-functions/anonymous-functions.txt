Anonymous Functions
-------------------
- An Anonymous function is a function w/o a name

- Common use case
    - In a Function Expression
        - Anonymous function referenced by the name of the constant or variable

    - In-place callback function of an Event Listener
        - Defines an Anonymous function as an in-place callback function

        - Instead of defining a callback function as Function expression
            - Referencing the constant or variable name

        - This approach is preferred when
            - There is NO other place w/in the codebase
                - To call the Anonymous function again
                - e.g. Executes when an Event occurs

        - Reduce the change of a memory leak due to an unreferenced object
            - As it is defined in-place w/in the Even Listener
            - NOTE: A function is a (special) object


- Why assign a name to an Anonymous function
    - When an error occurred w/in an Anonymous function
        - The browser is unable to provide the function name that triggered it
        - However, BOTH filename & line number where it occurred are provided

        Example:
        Uncaught ReferenceError: <variable> is not defined at HTMLButtonElement.<anonymous>

    - With a named Anonymous function
        - The browser provides a 'hint' by mentioning the function name

        Example:
        Uncaught ReferenceError: <variable> is not defined at HTMLButtonElement.startGame

    - NOTE: Providing a name to an Anonymous function
        - Quite helpful when debugging code 
        - But NOT necessary since BOTH the filename & line number 
            - Where the error occurred are provided
