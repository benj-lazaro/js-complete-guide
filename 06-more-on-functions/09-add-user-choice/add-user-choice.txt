Working On The Project: Adding User Choices To The Game
-------------------------------------------------------
- On the starter project "rock, paper & scissors"
    - Implement the option for a user to choose
        - Automatically convert the provided choice in uppercase

    - Defaults to the choice of "ROCK"
        - If the user does NOT provide a proper choice

    - Computer makes its own choice

    - Declare who won (i.e. computer or user)
        - On the browser's "console" tab


- On the starter code (app.js)
    - Define the following global constants & their corresponding string values
        - ROCK                  = "ROCK"
        - PAPER                 = "PAPER"
        - SCISSORS              = "SCISSORS"
        - DEFAULT_USER_CHOICE   = ROCK

    - Define a global variable named "gameIsRunning"
        - Assign a boolean value of "false"

    - Define a function named "getPlayerChoice()"
        - Accepts a player's choice of rock, paper or scissors
        
        - Use the Method ".toUpperCase()"
            - Automatically converts a user's valid input to uppercase

        - Define an "if" statement
            - To check if the user's input is valid
            - Otherwise, assign the selection of "rock" as the user's input

        - Return the user's selection


    - On the Event handler's anonymous function
        - Define an "if" statement
            - Check if the global variable "gameIsRunning" is truthy
            - If it is then return immediately
            - NOTE: This prevents from restarting the game

        - On the next line of code
            - Assign the boolean value of "true" to the global variable "gameIsRunning"

        - On the line after the "console.log()"
            - Define a local constant named "playerSelection"
            
            - Call the function "getPlayerChoice()
                - Assign the returned value to this constant

        - Call the "console.log()"
            - Pass the constant "playerSelection" as argument value
    
    - Save the changes

    - Load / reload the browser
        - Launch the browser's Chrome Dev Tools

        - Click the tab "Console"

        - Click the button "Start Game!"
            - Provide a correct choice
            - Provide an incorrect choice
