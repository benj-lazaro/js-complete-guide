Implementing The Core Game Logic
--------------------------------
- Implement code that mimics a computer opponent making a choice
    - Use Math.random() to generate a number value 
        - That will be based on the choice to be made by the computer

    - Math.random() is a static method that returns a floating-point value
        - That is greater than or equal to 0
        - And less than 1
