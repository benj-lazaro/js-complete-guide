Implementing The Core Game Logic
--------------------------------
- Implement the logic that 
    - Allows the opponent computer to make its choice

    - Use the method ".random()" of the object "Math"
        - Returns a floating-point value between 0 & 1 (i.e. 0.99 to be exact)
        - Reference (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/random)

    - The returned value & their corresponding "choice"
        - 0 to 0.33     = ROCK
        - 0.34 to 0.67  = PAPER
        - 0.67 to 0.99  = SCISSORS
    
    - Implement the logic to determine who wins the current round


- On the starter code (app.js)
    - Define the new global constants & their corresponding string values
        - RESULT_DRAW           = "DRAW"
        - RESULT_PLAYER_WINS    = "PLAYER"
        - RESULT_COMPUTER_WINS  = "COMPUTER"

    - Define an anonymous function
        - Save it to the local constant named "getComputerChoice"

        - Use "Math.random()"
            - To randomly choose a choice for the computer
            - Save the return value to the local constant named "randomValue"

        - Declare an "if" statement that
            - Assign the returned value to a specific choice for the computer

    - Define another anonymous function
        - Save it to the local constant named "getWinner"

        - It accepts two argument values
            - 1st   = computer's choice
            - 2nd   = player's choice

        - Declare an "if" statement that
            - Detemrines who wins the current round

    - On the anonymous function of the Event handler
        - Call the function "getComputerChoice()"
            - Save the returned value to the local constant "computerSelection"

        - Call the function "getWinner()"
            - Pass the local constants "playerSelection" & "computerSelection" as argument values
            - Save the returned value to the local constant "winner"

        - Call "console.log()"
            - Pass the constant "winner" as argument value

    - Save the changes
