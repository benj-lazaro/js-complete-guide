Understanding Callback Functions
--------------------------------
- A callback function is a function passed into another function as input
    - Which is then invoked inside the outer function to complete some kind of routine or action
    - Reference (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Callback_function)


- It is basically passing a function as an argument value to another function
    - Behind the scenes, it is passing a pointer (of a function) as an argument value to another function


- An event-based callback function is NEVER called directly
    - This function is called by an event at some point in the future
    - It is NOT called directly by the user
