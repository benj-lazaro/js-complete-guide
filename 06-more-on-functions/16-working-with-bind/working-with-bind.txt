Working With bind()
-------------------
- The .bind() method of function instances creates a new function
    - When called, calls this function with its "this" keyword
    - Set to the provided value and a given sequence of arguments preceding any provided
        - When the new function is called

    - Reference (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/bind)


Syntax:

bind(thisArg)
bind(thisArg, arg1)
bind(thisArg, arg1, arg2)
bind(thisArg, arg1, arg2, /* â€¦, */ argN)


- It helps pre-configure functions in places when there is a need to pass a value
    - But do NOT need to directly execute the function

- In calling .bind() method, it does not immediately get execute like that of a normal function
    - It prepares the associated object (or function in this case) prior to execution

- NOTE: The "this" keyword that is passed as an argument value to .bind() 
    - Is NOT yet discussed as of the time of this writing
