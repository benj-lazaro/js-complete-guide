Understanding Callback Functions
--------------------------------
- A Callback Function is a function
    - Passed as an argument value (pointer) to another function
        - Invoked w/in a function to complete an 

     - Reference (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Callback_function)


- An event listener Callback Function
    - Created in-place at another function's parameter field OR stored in a constant

    - It is NEVER executed directly like that of a normal function
        - Rather invokved by an Event (e.g. click) at some point in the future


- On the starter code (app.js)
    - NOTE: The implemented code is NOT related to the game

    - On global constant "sumUp"
        - Add a parameter variable named "resultHandler" as the 1st parameter
            - This stores the Callback Function passed as an argument value

        - Inside the Anonymous function
            - Refactor the "returm" statement that return the value of the local variable "sum"
            
            - Replace it by executing the Callback Function stored in the parameter variable "resultHandler"
                - Pass the local variable "sum" as argument value
                - NOTE: Include the pair of "( )" to execute the stored function

    - Outside the Anonymous function store in the global constant "sumUp"
        - Create a global constant named "showResult"

        - Assign an Anonymous function w/ the parameter variable named "result"

        - Inside the Anonymous function
            - Call the function "alert()"
            - Pass a string value w/ the value stored in the parameter variable "result"

    - Refactor the "console.log()" statements that
        - Call the Anonymous function stored in the global constant "sumUp"

        - Call the Anonymous function directly
            - Adding the pair of "( )" suffix

            - Pass the Anonymous function stored in the global constant "showResult" 
                - As the 1st argument value
                - Followed by previous argument values

            - This efffectively pass the function as argument value that
                - Will be executed w/n the Anonymous function of the global constant "sumUp"
