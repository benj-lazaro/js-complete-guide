.call() & .apply()
------------------
- When researching about the function method ".bind()"
    - The methods ".call()" & ".apply()" will likely be mentioned

    - BOTH methods
        - Allow to specify the argument value(s) 
            - Passed into the respective function object's parameter field

        - IMMEDIATELY executes the corresponding function object
            - The method ".bind()" does NOT
        
        - NOTE: The method ".bind()" is used MOST OFTEN than either of these two methods

    - These methods will be further explored in the later sections
