What Is The DOM
---------------
- The Document Object Model (DOM) represents a document with a logical tree
    - Each branch of the tree ends in a node
    - Each node contains an object
    - Reference (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model)


- The DOM methods allows programmatic access to the tree
    - You can change the document's structure, style or content

    - The DOM is NOT strictly tied to browsers
        - There are other tools that can parse the HTML document
        - It is NOT exclusively restricted to JavaScript


- The "document" interface represents any web page loaded in the browser
    - This serves as an entry point into the web page's content
    
    - It is a property of the "window" object also referred to as the Root DOM Node
        - It provides various methods to get access to the elements of the HTML document
            - To query for elements
            - To interface with the content of the DOM or loaded HTML document

    - Reference (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document)


- The "Window" interface represents a window containing the DOM document
    - It is basically the active browser window or tab
    
    - It is a global variable / object
        - This is the REAL topmost global object made available by the browser

        - It represents the (browser) window in which the script is running
        - It provides access to window-specific properties & methods to JavaScript
