What's The DOM?
---------------
- The Document Object Model (DOM)
    - The browser loads a HTML document
        - Parses the HTML code from top to bottom
        - Simultaneously render the elements & content 
        - Executes JavaScript code

    - Refers to the object representation of the HTML document loaded in & parsed by the browser
        - Offer access & interaction w/ the parsed HTML document via APIs
        - Work w/ the HTML document's structure, style or content

    - The DOM represents a document w/ a logical tree wherein
        - Each branch ends in a Node
        - Each Node contains an object

    - It is NOT strictly tied to browsers
        - There are other tools that can parse & work w/ the HTML document
        - NOT restricted to JavaScript

    - Reference (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model)


- The DOM has two (2) important built-in objects
    - The global object "document" is referred as the "Root DOM Node"
        - Provide access to & ability to interact w/ elements of the parsed HTML document

    - The global object "window" is referred as the "active browser window" (or tab)
        - The top-most global object made available by the browser            
            - It features a property named "document"

        - It represents the active browser window in which JavaScript is running
            - Acts as a global entry-point or storage for the script
            - Provide access to window-specific properties & methods
