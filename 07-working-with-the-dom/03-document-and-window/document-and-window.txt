document And window Object
--------------------------
- Playing around with the document & window objects using the browser's console tab


- Typing "document" returns the current document object loaded on the browser's window / tab
    - It returns the content of the HTML document 
        - Including elements, tags & content

    - It is actually JavaScript object that contains a representation of the rendered HTML document


- To access the properties of the document
    - Use console.dir()
    - Pass the value "document" as argument
    - Returns a read-only list of properties of the document & their corresonding values


- The console.dir() is a static method
    - Displays a list of properties of the specified JavaScript object in the browser console
    - Reference (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/console/dir_static)


- Typing "window" returns the current windows object
    - It contains a list of properties associated to the current / active browser window
    - It provides access to the core APIs that the browser provides 


- The "window" object is the top-most global object
    - When the browser parses and executes a JavaScript code 
        - Then it encounters an unresolved function / method being called
        - It automatically looks into the "window" object to see if it has it
        - If it does, it implicitly prepends the "window" object into the said method name

    - This object also contains the corresponding "document" object as a property

    - It ONLY gives access to the current active browser window / tab
        - Does NOT provide access to other windows / tabs of the browser
