Understanding The DOM
---------------------
- When the browser parse through an HTML document
    - It creates an object representation of each HTML element & corresponding content

    - The browser
        - Does NOT work w/ the actual HTML code
            - Rather w/ created objects (i.e. Nodes) that are stored in memory
            - e.g. HTML element <head> = Element Node "HEAD"
        
        - Organizes the Nodes into a tree-like structure
            - Mirroring the structure of the parsed HTML code
            - Keeps track of parent-child relations between different elements

    - Two (2) commonly used Nodes in the DOM
        - Element Node  = HTML element
        - Text Node     = Content including the un-rendered whitespace character that preceeds a Text Node


- Load the starter project (index.html) on the browser
    - Launch the Chrome Dev Tools (CTRL + SHIFT + I)
        - Click the tab "Console"

    - Typing "$0" on the tab "Console"
        - Refers to the last clicked or selected element in the tab "Elements"
            - Returns the corresponding HTML element (or Element Node)

        - NOTE: It is a browser (NOT JavaScript) feature that 
            - Makes it easier to select rendered HTML elements

        - Passing "$0" as an argument value to "console.dir()"
            - Returns the properties of the selected Element Node
