Understanding The DOM And How It's Created
------------------------------------------
- When the browser reads an HTML document
    - It renders the elements that have been parsed on the active window
    
    - An object is created to represent each HTML element
        - This object is translated as an "Element Node"

    - Text content are translated into "Text Node"
        - Unrendered whitespace preceeding a Text Node is also translated as a "Node"


- The browser then creates a tree of Element Nodes
    - Mirrors the structure of the parsed HTML document

    - Top-most node of the tree is the "HTML Node"

    - The "HTML Node" has two children nodes
        - HEAD  = has a child node TITLE
        - BODY  = has a variety of children nodes e.g. HEADER, MAIN, H1 and more


- To view how the brower reads & parses the DOM
    - Load the example file "index.html" on the browser
    - Launch the browser's Dev Tools
    - Click the "Elements" tab

    - Returns a human-readable representation of te DOM
        - Contains a variety of Element and Text Nodes 
        - It looks like an HTML code
        - BUT it is a "document" object that was read and rendered

    - Whitespace "Nodes" are NOT visually shown but represented as indents 
    

- Typing "$0" on the "Console" tab, followed by an ENTER key
    - Returns the RECENT element that was CLICKED in the "Elements" tab
    - NOTE: This is a feature of the Chrome browser's Dev Tools, NOT JavaScript

    - Passing "$0" as an argument value to console.dir()
        - Returns the properties of the RECENT element that was CLICKED in the "Elements" tab
