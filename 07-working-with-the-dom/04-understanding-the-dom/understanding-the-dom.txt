Understanding The DOM And How It's Created
------------------------------------------
- When the browser reads an HTML document
    - It renders the elements that have been parsed on the active window

    - An object representation of each HTML element / tag is then created
        - Translated into its corresponding Element node

    - Text content are translated into Text node
        - Unrendered whitespace preceeding Text nodes are also translated as a node


- The browser creates a tree of Element nodes
    - Mirroring the structure of the HTML document it has parsed
    
    - The topmost node of the tree is the HTML node

    - The HTML node has two child nodes:
        - HEAD
        - BODY 

    - The HEAD node has a child node named TITLE

    - The BODY node has a variety of child nodes
        - Such as HEADER, MAIN, H1 and more


- To witness how the browser reads and parses the DOM
    - Load the index.html into the browser
    - Open Dev Tools
    - Click the Elements tab

    - Displays a human-readable representation of the DOM
        - Along with its associated Element and Text nodes
        - Looks just like the HTML code 
        - BUT in reality it is a document object that is is being read & presented
    
    - NOTE: Nodes representing whitespaces are NOT shown 
        - BUT are visually represented as intendents


- Typing $0 on the console tab and then pressing ENTER
    - Returns the LAST element CLICKED in the Elements tab
    - NOTE: This is a Chrome Dev Tools feature and NOT of JavaScript

    - Using console.dir() and passing $0 as argument value
        - Returns the properties of the corresponding Element node selected as $0
