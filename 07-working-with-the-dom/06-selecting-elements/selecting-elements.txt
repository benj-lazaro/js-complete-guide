Selecting Elements In The DOM
-----------------------------
- An exploration on document methods:
    - getElementById()
        - The ONLY document method that returns an Element node by its ID attribute

    - getElementByClassName()

    - querySelector() and querySelectorAll()
        - Offers a powerful way of targeting individual elements
        - Best used for event listeners or manipulating elements


- These methods returns an Element node which is an object
    - They can also be used on the Element node itself
        - To search for specific element(s) on its child nodes
