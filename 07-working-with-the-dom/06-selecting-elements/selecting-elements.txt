Selecting Elements In The DOM
-----------------------------
- The selection method ".getElementById()"
    - The ONLY method that returns a matching Element node based on the targeted HTML attribute "id"


- The selection method ".getElementByClassName()"
    - Returns a single or collection of Element nodes that matches the targeted HTML attribute "class"
    - The collection of nodes are stored as elements of a live "HTMLCollection"


- The selection methods ".querySelector()" & ".querySelectorAll()"
    - The method ".querySelector()"
        - Returns the 1st matching Element node based on the targeted CSS selector

    - The method ".querySelectorAll()"
        - Returns a collection of matching Element nodes based on the targeted CSS selector
        - Stored as elements of a static "NodeList"
    
    - Best use case:
        - Event listeners
        - Manipulating Element nodes


- NOTE: ALL of the selection methods are NOT strictly tied to the "document" object
    - They can be used on the returned Element node(s) itself
        - To search for Element node(s) from its own child Element node(s)


- NOTE: To view the attached properties & methods of the returned Element node
    - Pass it as an argument value to "console.dir()"


- NOTE: The live "HTMLCollection" & static "NodeList" are array-like data structures
    - Can access their respective elements by their index values

    - Use either a "for" or "for..of" loops 
        - To iterate through their elements


- IMPORTANT: Properly import the external JavaScript file into a HTML document
    - To make sure that ALL element of the document have been parsed by the browser

    - Placing the HTML element <script> as child of the HTML element <head>
        - Requires the HTML attribute "defer"
            - Instructs the browser to download the JavaScript file
            - Execute it ONLY when the entire HTML document has been completely parsed

    - Placing the HTML element <script> as the last child of the HTML element <body>
        - Does NOT require the HTML attribute "defer"

    - Either of the two HTML element <script> placement area will suffice
        - Solely left to the developer's choice


- On the starter project (app.js)
    - Use the selection method ".getElementById()"
        - To find & select an Element node from the "document" w/ an HTML attribute "id" value of "main-title"
            - Pass the method as an argument value to "console.log()"
    
        - To view the attached properties & methods of the returned Element node
            - Save the returned Element node to a constant
            - Pass the constant as argument value to "console.dir()"

    - Use the selection method ".getElementByClassName()"
        - To find & select an Element node from the "document" w/ an HTML attribute "class" value of "list-item"
            - Pass the method as an argument value to "console.log()"        
    
    - Use the selection method ".querySelector()"
        - To find & select an Element node from the "document" based on the passed CSS selector as argument value
            - Look for an Element node w/ a CSS class selector ".list-item"
            - Pass the method as an argument value to "console.log()"

        - To find & select the 1st child Element node of the HTML element <ul>
            - Use CSS element & pseudo-attribute selectors 
            - Save the returned Element node to a constant named "firstChild"
            - Pass the constant as an argument value to "console.log()"

        - To find & select the last child Element node of the HTML element <ul>
            - Use CSS element & pseudo-attribute selectors 
            - Save the returned Element node to a constant named "lastChild"
            - Pass the constant as an argument value to "console.log()"

    - Use the selection method ".querySelectorAll()"
        - To find & select matching Element nodes from the "document" based on the passed CSS selector as argument value
            - Look for Element nodes w/ a CSS class selector ".list-item"
            - Save the returned Element nodes to a constant named "list"
            - Pass the constant as argument value to "console.log()"
