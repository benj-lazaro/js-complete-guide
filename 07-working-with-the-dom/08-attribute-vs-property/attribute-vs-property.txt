Attributes VS Properties
------------------------
- An attribute is often (but NOT always) mapped to a property
    - Implemented in HTML code
    - As part of an HTML element / tag name

    - Serves as a default configuration to the DOM object to be created


- Browser automatically creates a pre-configured DOM object
    - That contains properties based on
        - HTML element / tag name
        - Corresponding attributes & assigned values


- NOTE: NOT every attribute name has a 1:1 mapping to their counterpart property name
    - Changing the assigned value of the property "value"
        - Is NOT reflected on the assigned value of attribute "value"
        - To reflect the changes, use setAttribute()

    - Changing the assigned value of the property "id"
        - Is reflected on the assigned value of the attribute "id"


- Use setAttribute() to set the value of an attribute on the specified element
    - This is an Element method that accepts two argument values
        - Attribute name
        - Assigned value

    - This update does NOT get reflected on the HTML document rendered by the browser
        - It updates the assigned value of the specified element's attribute in the DOM

    - Reference (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/setAttribute)


Syntax:

setAttribute(name, value)
