Exploring & Changing DOM Properties
-----------------------------------
- To evaluate & manipulate the value of properties from a selected Element node
    - Use the "=" operator to assign a new value to a property
        
        p.className = "new-class"

    - NOTE: NOT ALL properties of an Element node are writable


- Commonly accessed properties of an Element node
    - ".textContent"    = text content of the Element node
    - ".id"             = value of the Element node's HTML attribute "id"
    - ".className"      = value of the Element node's HTML attribute "class"


- To determine what properties are available to an Element node
    - Pass the selected Element node as argument value to "console.dir()"
        - Play around w/ the values of properties
        - Simply reload the browser when something goes wrong

        - NOTE: This is the STRONGLY RECOMMENDED approach

    - An alternative is to use MDN (Mozilla Developer Network)
        - The "DOM Interface" section of each HTML element
            - Provides a list of related properties & methods
            - Provides information (i.e. flag)  if a property is READ-ONLY or NOT

    - NOTE: Changes in the Element node's properties w/in the browser's "console" tab
        - Will be lost after the browser is reloaded


- On the starter project
    - Select the HTML element <h1>
        - Change the text content to "Some new text!"
        
        - Assign "title" to its HTML attribute "class"
        
        - Set the text color to "white" & background color to "red"
            - Use the property ".style"
                - To access a list of CSS styling properties

    - Save the changes

    - Load / reload the browser
        - Inspect changes using Chrome's Dev Tools
