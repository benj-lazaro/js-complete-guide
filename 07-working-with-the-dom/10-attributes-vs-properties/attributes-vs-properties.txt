Attributes VS Properties
------------------------
- An attribute is part of a HTML element (i.e. tag)
    - When the browser parses through the HTML document
        - It creates an Element node based on an HTML Element

    - The attributes defined w/in an HTML Element translates to
        - The properties of its corresponding Element node

    - The assigned values on an HTML Element's attributes
        - Becomes the assigned values of the corresponding Element node's properties

    - NOTE: NOT every every attribute has
        - A 1:1 mapping w/ their Element node property counterpart
            - Mapping = the name of an attribute & property are IDENTICAL

        - Live synchronization w/ their property counterpart
            - Updating the assigned value on an Element node's property
            - Updates the hardcoded value assigned to the corresponding HTML element's attribute

        - The Element node property "id"
            - Has 1:1 mapping & live synchronization w/ its HTML attribute "id" counterpart

        - The Element node property "className"
            - Has NO 1:1 mapping BUT has live synchronization w/ its HTML attribute "class" counterpart

        - The Element node property "value"
            - Has 1:1 mapping BUT NO live synchronization w/ its HTML attribute "value" counterpart
            
            - Updating the value of the property "value"
                - Will NOT update the hardcoded assigned value on the corresponding HTML attribute "value"


- To update (set) the value of HTML attributes that
    - Has NO live synchronization w/ their Element node property counterpart
        - Requires the use of the Element node's method ".setAttribute()"

    - It requires two (2) argument value
        - Target HTML attribute name
        - New value to assign (set)
    
    Syntax:
    <element_node>.setAttribute("<attribute_name>", "<new_value>");


    - NOTE: This method sets a new value of the HTML attribute
        - Reflects the changes in the HTML code
            - However, does NOT update the rendered DOM in the browser

        - The previous value of the HTML attribute is still kept in memory
            - Can be used for re-assigning back to the corresponding property of the Element node

            - Using the Element node's method ".getAttribute()"
                - Accepts the HTML attribute "value" as argument
                - Store the returned value back into the Element node's property "value"

    Syntax:
    <element_node>.value = <element_node>.getAttribute("<attribute_name>");

  
- On the starter project (index.html)
    - Add an HTML element <input>, underneath the HTML element <ul>
        - Declare the HTML attribute "value"
        - Assign the value "default text"


    - Switch to the file "app.js"
        - Select the HTML element <input> from the DOM
            - Using the "document" method ".querySelector()" w/ "input" as argument value
        
        - Save the returned Elenment node in a constant named "input"
        
        - Pass "input.value" as argument value to "console.log"
            - Returns the value "default text"


    - Assign a new value to the property ".value" of the Element node "input"
        - Use the "=" operator
            - Assign the string value "some other input the user might have entered"
       
        - Save the changes
            - The new value "some other input the user might have entered" is 
                - Rendered on the browser
                - NOT reflected on the DOM
            

    - To set a new value to the attribute "value" of the HTML element <input> on the DOM
        - Use the method ".setAttribute()"
            - 1st argument  = HTML attribute "value"
            - 2nd argument  = string value "some other default text"

        - Save the changes
            - The new value "some other default text" is 
                - NOT rendered on the browser
                - Reflected on the DOM


    - Assign another new value to the property ".value" of the Element node "input"
        - Use the "=" operator
            - Assign the string value "another attempt"
        
        - Save the changes
            - The new value "another attempt" is 
                - Rendered on the browser
                - NOT reflected on the DOM


    - To fetch the previously set value on the attribute "value" of the HTML element <input> on the DOM
        - Use the Elemet node method ".getAttribute()"
            - 1st argument = HTML attribute "value"

        - Assign the returned value to the Element node's property ".value"

        - Save the changes
            - The new value "another attempt" is 
                - Rendered on the browser
                - Reflected on the DOM
