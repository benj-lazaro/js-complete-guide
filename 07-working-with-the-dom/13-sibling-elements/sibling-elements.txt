Selecting Sibling Elements
--------------------------
- Explore accessing the previous and next siblings nodes/elements using the traversal properties:
    - previousSibling
    - previousElementSibling
    - nextSibling
    - nextElementSibling
    
    - NOTE: Using these properties is much quicker to the browser than the .querySelector() method
        - The latter reads the entire HTML document first
        - Then searches for the matching criteria 
        - It is NOT bad but has some performance penalities
