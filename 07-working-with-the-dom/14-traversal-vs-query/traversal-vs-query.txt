DOM Traversal VS Query Methods
------------------------------
- DOM traversal
    - If an element is already selected by a query method
    - Using DOM travesal properties to access ancestor, child, parent or sibling elements
    - Offers better performance than performing another query method
    
    - Use it in cases that the element relations being traversed will STAY THE SAME
        - Even if the HTML code has been refactored
        - e.g. ordered and/or unordered list and their list items

    - The code can be a bit hard to read
        - It may NOT immediately obvious to other who will read the code
        - Particularly if the constant / variable name is chosen poorly

    - The web app may introduce unexpected behavior or break
        - When the HTML document is refactored
        - Requires updating the JavaScript code and associated traversal properties

    - Deeply nested traversal logic will NOT yield any better performance
        - Likely worse than using query methods


- Query method
    - Best used when generally selecting an element or node

    - It does NOT exactly yield a horrible performance
        - It just takes a few more steps before selecting an element or node

    - Less likely for the web app to unexpectedly break 
        - When the HTML document is refactored


- NOTE: There is NO STRICT right or wrong when choosing which one to use
