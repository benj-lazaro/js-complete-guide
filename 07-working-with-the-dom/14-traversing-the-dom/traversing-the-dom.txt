Traversing The DOM: Overview
----------------------------
- Traversing the DOM is a concept that meant 
    - Once an Element node is selcted
        - It provides the ability to dive into ALL of its child, parent or sibling Element nodes
            - To add, remove or manipulate
            - Rather than manually selecting every (child, parent or sibling) Element nodes
        
    - Terminologies used w/ the current selected Element node
        - child         = direct child Element node; NOT a nested child
        - descendant    = direct or indirect child Element node; includes nested child Element nodes
        - parent        = direct parent Element node
        - ancestor      = direct or indirect parent Element node

    - Methods
        - Element node method ".closest()"
            - Traverses the DOM for a direct parent or any ancestor Element node that matches the specified CSS selector
            - Reference (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/closest)

        - "document" methods ".querySelector()", ".getElementsByClassName() & so on
            - Previous learned selection methods to select (Element, Text, etc.) nodes from the DOM
            - To dive deeper into ALL of the current selected Element node's descendants
