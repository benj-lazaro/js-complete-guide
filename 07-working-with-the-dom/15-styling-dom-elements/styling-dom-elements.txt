Styling DOM Elements
--------------------
- Using the property "style"
    - This is is a READ-ONLY property of the HTMLElement
        - Returns the inline style of an element
            - In the form of a live CSSStyleDeclaration object
            - List of all style properties for the target element
            - It has the highest level of specificity

    - The style property names are based on CSS properties
        - BUT have their names are adjusted
        - NO "-" to separate names and adopt the camelcase naming convention

- Using the property "classname"
    - This is a property of the Element interface
        - Gets and sets the value of the attribute class of the specified element

    - Sets / control all classes at once

    - Can also control the attribute id or other properties
        - When using an attribute or id selector in the CSS code

    - Toggling classes requires managing it manually
        - Keeping track of the classes that you don't want to remove
        - Remove the classes that you want to get rid of
        - Requires quite a bit of code to implement

    - Reference (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/className)


- Using the property "classList"
    - This is is a READ-ONLY property of the Element interface
        - Returns a live DOMTokenList collection of the attribute class of the specified element
        - DOMTokenList is a case-sensitive array-like object

    - It comes with methods to add, remove or toggle CSS classes

    - Fine-grained control over classes that are dynamically added, removed or toggled
        - Offers writing less code

    - It can be used with property "className" with care
