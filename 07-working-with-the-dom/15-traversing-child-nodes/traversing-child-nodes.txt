Traversing Child Nodes
----------------------
- Explore traversing child nodes in the DOM
    - Using the property ".children"
        - Returns a live "HTMLCollection" that contains ONLY child Element nodes

    - Using the property ".childNodes"
        - Returns a static "NodeList" that contains ALL child nodes
            - This includes both Element & Text nodes

        - NOTE: Using properties like ".children" or ".childNodes" is cheaper than
            - Using the method ".querySelector()" to select child nodes
            
            - The method costs a little bit of performance
                - Scans the DOM
                - Checks the target CSS selector 
                - Finds the matching child element

            - Whereas the said properties directly points to the targeted child node

    - To select the 1st child node
        - Use either ".firstChild" or ".firstElementChild"
            - BOTH returns the 1st child node
            - Latter returns the 1st child Element node

    - To select the last child node
        - Use either ".lastChild" or ".lastElementChild"
            - BOTH returns the last child node
            - Latter returns the last child Element node


- On the start project (app.js)
    - Select the 2nd child HTML element <li> of the <ul>

    - Use the "document" object method ".querySelector()" to 
        - Select the parent HTML element <ul>
        - Store the retured Element node in a constant name "ul"

    - To access the 2nd child Element node
        - Use the property ".children" on the Element node stored in the constant "ul"
            - Followed by the 2nd child's index value of 1
            
            - NOTE: BOTH "HTMLCollection" & "NodeList" are zero (0) based index
