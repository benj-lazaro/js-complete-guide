Using parentNode & parentElement
--------------------------------
- Explore traversing the parent nodes from a child node perspective.
    - Using properties ".parentNode" & ".parentElement"
        - Returns the nearest direct parent Element node of a child node
        
        - IMPORTANT: Each node in the DOM can ONLY have one (1) parent node
        
        - NOTE: ONLY an Element node can have a child node
            - A Text node can NOT have a child node


- To access a child node's ancestor
    - Use the method ".closest()"
        - Pass the target CSS selector as argument value
            - To pick the nearest ancestor Element node (e.g. "body")

        - NOTE: Does NOT work w/ a sibling Element node
            - Returns the value of "null"


- To access a child node's nearest descendant
    - Use the method ".querySelector()"
        - Pass the target CSS selecto as argument value
            - To pick the nearest descendant Element node

            
- In the starter project (app.js)
    - To select the parent node of the 1st HTML element <li>
        - Select the 1st child Element node <li> using the "document" object method ".querySelector()"
        - Store the returned Element node in a constant named "liFirst"

    - To select the parent node
        - Use either properties ".parentElement" or ".parentNode"
            - Returns the Element node "ul" along w/ its children Element nodes "li"

    - To select the ancestor node
        - Use the method ".closest()" on the child node "liFirst"
            - Pass the CSS selector "body" as argument value
            - Returns the ancestor node
