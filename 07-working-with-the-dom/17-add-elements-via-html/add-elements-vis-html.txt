Adding Elements Via HTML
------------------------
- Using the property innerHTML
    - Replaces the targeted element's entired nested HTML structure with new HTML code
    - Specifically its children / descendant nodes
    - Reference (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/innerHTML)

    - Adding new element requires the browser to re-render the entire targeted element
        - Re-renders HTML code including those that did NOT get changed
        - This is NOT great for performance

    - Use case
        - Replace the entire HTML structure of the targeted element's descendants
        - NOT ideal for adding new element(s) after the last child element / descendant


- Using the method insertAdjacentHTML()
    - Append a new element into the targeted element's descendants
    - Requires the position of the new element and the actual HTML code as argument values
    - Position values
        - beforebegin
        - afterbegin
        - beforeend
        - afterend
