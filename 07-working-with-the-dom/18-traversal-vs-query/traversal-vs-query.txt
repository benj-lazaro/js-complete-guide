DOM Traversal VS Query Methods
------------------------------
- DOM traversal
    - Use when an Element node is already been select using a Query method 

    - Use various properties to traverse through the DOM
        - To access an ancestor, child, parent or sibling

    - PROS
        - Offers better performance than performing another Query method
        - Requires less steps to select the targeted node

    - CONS
        - The code can be a bit hard to read
            - It is NOT immediately obvious to the one reading the code
            - Particularly if the name of the contant is chosen poorly
            - Requires reading the HTML code to understand what is actuallly going on

        - Web app may introduce unexpected behavior or unexpectedly break
            - When its HTML code is refactored
            - Require updating the JavaScript code & associated DOM traversal properties

        - Deeply nested traversal logic
            - Will NOT yield better performance
            - Likely be worse then using Query methods   - e.g. unoredered list

    - Use case:
        - When relations between DOM nodes (being traversed) remains the same
            - Even after the HTML code is refactored


- Query methods
    - Best when selecting a specific Element node or node 

    - NOT necessarily yields horrible performance
        - Just requires a few more steps before able to select the targeted node

    - Less likely for the web app to unexpectedly break
        - When its HTML code is refactored


- Bottom line: There is NO strict right or wrong when choosing w/c one to use
