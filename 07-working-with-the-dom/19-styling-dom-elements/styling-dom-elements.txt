Styling DOM Elements
--------------------
- Exploring ways to manipulate & chaning the styles of Element nodes

- Using the READ-ONLY property ".style"
    - Directly targets individual CSS style properties applied to that Element node
        - Similar to using inline CSS on the targeted HTML element
        - NOTE: This has the HIGHEST SPECIFICITY level

    - Property names are based on CSS properties
        - But their names have been adjusted
        - NOTE: Camelcase names used instead of the conventional CSS property name
            - e.g. "backgroundColor" instead of "background-color"
    
    - Reference (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/style)


- Using the property ".className"
    - Directly sets the CSS classes assigned to an Element node
        - To dynamically add, remove or toggle classes using a CSS Class selectors

    - It takes a single string argument
        - The class name to be added, removed or toggle
        
    - Allows to set or control ALL class at once

    - Alternatively, changing the attribute "id" or any HTML attribute
        - Using an CSS ID or Attribute selector, respectively

    - Reference (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/className)


- Using the READ-ONLY property ".classList"
    - Provides an easy way to manage assigned classes on an Element node
        - Offers more flexibility

    - It comes w/ built-in methods
        - To add, remove or toggle CSS Class selectors

    - Provides fine-grain control over classes that are added
        - Can be used in conjunction w/ the property ".className" w/ care
            - Careful that it will not OVERWRITE each other
        
        - Typically use either ".className" or ".classList"

    - Reference (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/classList)

    - The ".classList" method ".contains()"
        - Quickly checks if a class is set on an Element node

    - The ".classList" method ".add()" & ".remove()"
        - Respectively, adds & removes a class from an Element node

    - The ".classList" method ".toggle()" 
        - Offers an easy way to change (toggle) assigned classes on an Element node
        - Accepts the class(es) to be swapped w/ the previous class(es) as argument value(s)


- On the starter project (index.html)
    - Implement an internal CSS on the HTML document
        - Declare a CSS Class selector named ".red-bg"
            - Set the value of "background-color" to "red"
            - Set the value of "color" to "white"

        - Declare a CSS Class selector named ".visible"
            - Set the value of "display" to "block"

        - Declare a CSS Class selector named ".invisible"
            - Set the value of "display" to "none"

    - On the HTML element <section>
        - Declare a HTML attribute "class"
        - Assign the value of "red-bg" & "visible"

    - Right after the HTML element <section>
        - Add a new HTML element <button> w/ the content text of "Toggle Visibility"

    - Next add a new HTML element <input> w/ the following HTML attributes
        - HTML attribute "type" w/ the assigned value of "text"
        - HTML attribute "value" w/ the assigned value of "default text"
    
    - Save the changes

    - Switch to the file "app.js"
        - Select the HTML element <section> using the method ".querySelector()"
            - Pass the value "section" as an argument value
            - Store the returned Element node in a constant named "section"

        - Use the property ".className" 
            - To remove the assigned classes from the Element node "section"
            - Assigning an empty string

        - Select the HTML element <button> using the method ".querySelector()"
            - Pass the value "button" as an argument value
            - Store the returned Element node in a constant named "button"

        - Hook an Event listener to the Element node "button" 
            - Using the method ".addEventListener()"
                - To listen to an Event "click
            
            - Use a callback Arrow function 
                - To change (toggle) the assigned Classes to the Element node "section"

            - Inside the Arrow function
                - Use the property ".classList"
                    - To retrieve the currently assigned classes 

                - Chain the method ".toggle()"
                    - Pass the class "invisible" as argument value

                - Whenever a "click" event occurs
                    - The class "invisible" replaces the classes w/in the property ".classList"

        - Save the changes
            - Load / reload the browser

            - Clicking the button
                - Toggles the visibility of the HTML element <section> on the DOM
