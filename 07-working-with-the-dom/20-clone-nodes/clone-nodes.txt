Cloning DOM Nodes
-----------------
- The method cloneNode of the Node interface
    - Returns a duplicate of the node on which this method is called
    - It copies ALL attributes and corresponding values
        - Including intrinsic (inline) listeners
        - It does NOT copy event listeners using .addEventListener() 
        - The <canvas> element is NOT copies

    - The argument deep is equals to true copies/clones EVERYTHING
        - Including all of the child and descendant nodes (including Text nodes)
        - The value of false (default) will only clone the node

    - NOTE: It may duplicate an element's ID in a document
        - It is advised to modify the ID attribute of the clone node to be unique

    - Reference (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node/cloneNode)


Syntax:

cloneNode()
cloneNode(deep)


- Common use case:
    - Instead of creating a separate element/node with an identical properties
    - Better clone the original and modify the properties of the clone element/node
    - Doing so saves times
