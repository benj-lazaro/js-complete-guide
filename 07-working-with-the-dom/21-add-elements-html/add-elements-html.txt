Add Elements Via HTML Code
--------------------------
- The property ".innerHTML"
    - Replaces the Element node's entire nested HTML structure w/ a new HTML code
        - REPLACES ALL child nodes including descendant nodes

    - Use case:
        - Good for replacing the HTML structure of an Element node's descendants

        - NOT GOOD for adding / inserting new Element node(s) to 
            - The existing HTML structure of a selected Element node
        
        - NOTE: A workaround is to assign an expression based on
            - The current value of the ".innerHTML", the "+" operator & the new HTML mark-up
                - Then assign the expression back (as a new value) to the property ".innerHTML"

                <Element_node>.innerHTML = <Element_node>.innerHTML + "<new_HTML_mark-up>";

        - The downside of this workaround
            - It replaces tne entire structure of the 
                - Selected Element node & ALL of its descendants

            - It is NOT great for performance
                - Hurts the User Experience (UX)

            - It forces the browser to render a lot of HTML mark-up that
                - Did NOT get updated at all


- The method ".insertAdjacentHTML()"
    - Appends a new child Element node into the selected Element node's descendants
    
    - The method requires two (2) argument values
        - 1st   = position of the Element node to be inserted
        - 2nd   = actual HTML mark-up to be inserted as a new child Element node

    - The position values are as follows:
        - "beforebegin" = before the selected Element node
        - "afterbegin"  = inside the selected Element node, BEFORE its 1st child node
        - "beforeend"   = inside the selected Element node, AFTER its last child
        - "afterend"    = after the selected Element node

- On the starter project (app.js)
    - Select the HTML element <section> using the method ".querySelector()"
        - Pass "section" as argument value
        - Store the returned Element node to a constant named "section"

    - Replace the nested HTML structure of the Element node "section"
        - Using the property ".innerHTML"
        - Assign a new HTML mark-up
        
    - Select the HTML element <ul> using the method ".querySelector()"
        - Pass "ul" as argument value
        - Store the returned Element node to a constant named "list"

    - Add new child Element nodes using the property ".innerHTML"
        - Appending the existing value of ".innerHTML" w/ a new HTML mark-up using the "+" operator
        - Store the expression as a new value back to the property ".innerHTML" of the Element node "list"

    - Select the HTML element <div> using the method ".querySelector()"
        - Pass "div" as argument value
        - Store the returned Element node to a constant named "div"

    - Insert a new child Element node to the select Element node "div"
        - Using the method ".insertAdjacentHTML()"
            - Pass the argument values
                - 1st   = "beforeend"
                - 2nd   = "<p>Something went wrong!</p>"

        - Effectively inserts a new child Element node "p"
            - Right after the existing (previously) last child Element node "input"
    
    - Save the changes
    
    - Load / reload the browser
