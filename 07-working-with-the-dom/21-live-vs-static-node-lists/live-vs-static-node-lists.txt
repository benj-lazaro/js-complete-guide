Live Node Lists VS Static Node Lists
------------------------------------
- Live NodeList meant that any changes in the DOM automatically updates the collection
    - It could lead to a higher memory consumption when managing a lot of collections
        - Although this is a niche occurence

    - The methods .getElementsByTagName(), .getElementsByClassName, .getElementsByName
        - Returns a live HTMLCollection


- Static NodeList meant that any changes in the DOM does NOT affect the collection
    - It offers better performance & less memory consumption

    - The method .querySelectorAll() returns a static NodeList
