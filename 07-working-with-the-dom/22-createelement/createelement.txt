Adding Element Via createElement()
----------------------------------
- Use the "document" object method ".createElement()"
    - To create a new Element node in the DOM
        - Takes the HTML tag name of the Element node to be created as argument value
        
        - Optionally, accepts a 2nd argument of an object w/ an "is" property
            - To be tackled the later on the advanced section

        - Returns a "HTMLUnknownElement" object if the tag name is NOT recognized

    - NOTE: ALWAYS call the method ".createElement()" on the "document" object
        - Do NOT call this method on any other DOM node (object)

    - This method provide direct access to the created Element node that
        - Allows to set properites (e.g. textContent, className, etc.)
        - Attach an Event listener

    - Reference (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/createElement)

    Syntax:
    document.createElement(<tag_name>);
    document.createElement(<tag_name>, [<options>]);


- In the starter project (app.js)
    - Select the HTML element <ul> using the method ".querySelector()"
        - Pass the value "ul" as argument value
        - Store the returned Element node to a constant named "list"

    - Create a new element using the "document" object's method ".createElement()"
        - Pass the value "li" as argument value
        - Store the created Element node to a constant named "newLi"

    - Set the property ".textContent" of the created Element node "newLi"
        - Assign the value of "Item 4"

    - Append the Element node "newLi" as a new child node to the Element node "list"
        - Call the method ".appendChild()" on the Element node "list"
        - Pass the Element node "newLi" as argument value

    - Save the changes

    - Load / reload the browser
        - A new HTML element <li> w/ the content of "Item 4" is rendered on the DOM
