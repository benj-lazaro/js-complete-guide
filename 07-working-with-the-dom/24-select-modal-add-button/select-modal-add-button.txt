Seleting The Model And Add Button
---------------------------------
- Clicking the "Add Movie" button renders a data-entry modal
    - The modal is a <div> element with an "id" attribute set to "add-modal"

    - The modal is currently hidden
        - Defined by the CSS class "modal"
        - Property "display" set to none


- Implement JavaScript code that renders the modal 
    - Assign an event listener on the "Add Movie" button
    - Listen for a "click" event
    - When "clicked", add the classes "modal" and "visible" to the modal element
