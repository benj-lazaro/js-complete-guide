Cloning DOM Nodes
-----------------
- The DOM node method ".cloneNode"
    - Returns a duplicate of the node that called this method
    
    - Passing a boolean value "true" as argument value
        - Performs a "deep clone" w/c includes ALL child & descendant nodes

    - Passing a boolean value "false" (default) as argument value
        - Performs a clone of the node itself ONLY

    - NOTE: If an Element node has an "id" attribute set
        - The method will also clone the original Element node's "id"
        - Advised to modify the clone's "id" attribute (ASAP) to make it unique

    - Use case:
        - Instead of creating a new Element node w/ identical properties of an original node
            - It will save time to simply clone the original Element node
            - Then update the values of properties accordingly

    - Reference (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node/cloneNode)


- On the starter project (app.js)
    - Select the HTML element <ul> using the method ".querySelector()"
        - Store the returned Element node to a constant named "list"

    - Create a new Element node using the method ".createElement()"
        - Pass the argument value "li"
        - Store the returned Element node to a constant named "newLi"
    
    - Set the property ".textContent" of the Element node "newLi" to the value of "Item4"

    - Deep clone the Element node "newLi" using the method ".cloneNode()
        - Pass the boolean value "true" as argument value to perform a deep clone
        - Store the cloned Element node to a constant named "newLi2"

    - Append both Element nodes "newLi" & "newLi2" as child node of the parent Element node "list"
        - Using the method ".append()"

    - Save the changes

    - Load / reload the browser
        - The unordered list should have two (2) duplicate "Item 4" items
