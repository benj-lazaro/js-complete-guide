Live Node List VS Static Node List
----------------------------------
- A "HTMLCollection" (i.e. live "NodeList")
    - An array-like collection that contains "live" DOM nodes
    
    - Any changes in the selected DOM nodes 
        - Are automatically reflected on the "HTMLCollection"

    - This may lead to higher memory consumption
        - When managing a lot of "HTMLCollection"
        - Although this incident would be a niche occurence

    - The following methods return a live "HTMLCollection"
        - ".getElementsByTagName()"
        - ".getElementsByClassName()"
        - ".getElementsByName()"


- A static NodeList
    - Any changes in the DOM (nodes) does NOT update the "NodeList"
        - An array-like collection that contains a snapshot of the DOM nodes

    - It consumes less memory & offers better performance

    - The following methods return a static "NodeList"
        - ".querySelector()"
        - ".querySelectorAll()"
