Deleting Movie Elements
-----------------------
- Implement code that delete movie elements from the HTML document
    - Define a function expression that handles the deletion of a movie element (object)
        - Name the function as deleteMovieHandler()
        - Use the .splice() method to remove the movie element from the NodeList
        - Use the property .children, pass the index of the movie element 
            Call the method .remove() to remove from the DOM

    - Add a "click" event listener to each of the movie element
        - Refactor function expression renderNewMovieElement
        - Add an event listener to each rendered movie element (object)
        - Use the callback function deleteMovieHandler()
        - Use .bind() to help identify which movie to be delete from the UI when calling deleteMovieHandler()

    - Refactor function expression renderNewMovieElement()
        - Add the argument variable "id" as the 1st argument
            - Identifies the movie to be deleted 

    - Refactor JavaScript object newMovie
        - Add a new property named "id"
        - Assign with a value generated by Math.random().toString()
            - This is to generate somewhat a unique ID for each movie object added to the UI
            - NOTE: Math.random() does NOT exactly generate a unique number but would suffice for now
