Controlling The Backdrop
------------------------
- Implement the logic that 
    - Toggles the backdrop behind the modal in a function

    - Call the function when the
        - Modal's "Cancel" button is clicked
        - Modal's backdrop is clicked


- On the practice project (assets/scripts/app.js)
    - Select the HTML element <div> w/ the attribute "class" of "backdrop"
        - Using the method ".getElementById()"
        - Pass "backdrop" as argument value
        - Store the returned element to the constant named "backdrop"

    - Select the HTML element <button> w/ the attribute "class" of "btn--passive"     
        - Use the method ".querySelector()" on the object "addMovieModal"
        - Pass "btn--passive" as argument value
        - Store the returned Element node to the constant named "cancelAddMovieButton"
        - NOTE: This is the 1st button w/in Element node "addMovieModal"

    - Create an Arrow function stored in a constant named "toggleBackdrop"
        - On the Element node "backdrop"
            - Attach the property ".classList"

        - The chain the method ".toggle()"
            - Pass the class named "visible" as argument value

        - NOTE: This toggles the backdrop ONLY

    - Refactor the arrow function stored in a constant named "toggleMovieModal"
        - On the last line, call the function "toggleBackdrop()"
            - Effectively toggles BOTH backdrop & model

        - NOTE: This serves as a callback function for the Element node "startAddMovieButton"

    - Create an Arrow function stored in a constant named "backgroundClickHandler"
        - Calls the function "toggleMovieModal()"
            - Effectively toggles BOTH backdrop & model

        - NOTE: This serves as a callback function for the Element node "backdrop"

    - Create an Arrow function stored in a constant named "cancelAddMovie"
        - Calls the function "toggleMovieModal()"
            - Effectively toggles BOTH backdrop & modal

        - NOTE: This serves as a callback function for the Element node "cancelAddMovieButton"

    - Save the changes

    - Load / reload the browser
        - Click the button "ADD Movie"
            - Closes BOTH modal & backdrop

        - Click the "Cancel" button
            - Closes BOTH modal & backdrop

        - Click the backdrop
            - Closes BOTH modal & backdrop
