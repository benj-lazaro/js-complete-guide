Controlling The Backdrop
------------------------
- Implement the logic that 
    - Toggles the backdrop behind the modal in a function

    - Call the function when the
        - Modal's "Cancel" button is clicked
        - Modal's backdrop is clicked


- On the practice project (assets/scripts/app.js)
    - Select the HTML element <div> with the attribute "class" of "backdrop"
        - Using the method ".getElementById()"
        - Pass "backdrop" as argument value
        - Store the returned element to the constant named "backdrop"
