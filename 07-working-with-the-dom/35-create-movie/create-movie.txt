Creating A Movie In JavaScript & Clearning The Input
----------------------------------------------------
- Implement the corresponding logic that
    - Stores the collected user inputs in memory
    - Clears the fields after clicking the modal's "Add" button
    - Clears the fields after clicking the modal's "Cancel" button


- On the starter project (assets/scripts/app.js)
    - Create a new constant named "movies"
        - Assign it w/ an empty array
        - Will hold the collection of movie objects in memory

    - Refactor the callback Arrow function "addMovieHandler"
        - Right after the "if" statement
            - Declare a new constant named "newMovie"

        - Assign an JavaScript object to the constant "newMovie" 
            - It contains the following properties
                - title     = assigned w/ the value stored in "titleValue"
                - image     = assigned w/ the value stored in "imageUrlValue"
                - rating    = assigned w/ the value stored in "ratingValue"

        - On the object "movies"
            - Use the method ".push()"
            - Pass the object "newMovie" as argument value

        - Call the Arrow function "toggleMovieModal()"
            - Closes the modal after the button "Add" is clicked

    - Crew a new Arrow function that clears the modal's input fields
        - Store the function on a constant named "clearMovieInput"
        - Located above the Arrow function "cancelAddMovieHandler"

        - Use a "for..of" loop on the Element node "userInputs"
            - Iterate through each NodeList element
            - Assign an empty string as value

    - On the callback function "cancelAddMovieHandler"
        - At the last line, call the function "clearMovieInput()"

    - On the callback function "addMovieHandler"
        - At the last line, call the function "clearMovieInput()"

    - Save the changes

    - Load / reload the browser
        - Adding or cancelling user inputs on the modal
            - Should clear ALL fields
        
        - Adding a new user input
            - Displayed as an array element in the browser's JavaScript console
