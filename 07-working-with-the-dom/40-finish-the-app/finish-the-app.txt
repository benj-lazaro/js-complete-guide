Finish The App
--------------
- Finish the app by addressing the problems
    - Click "ADD MOVIE" button w/c renders the Modal
        - Entering data on the "Movie Title" field
        - Then click the "Cancel" button
        - Closes the Modal but the user input remains

    - Click "ADD MOVIE" button w/c renders the Modal
        - Entering data on the "Movie Title" field
        - Then click the "Cancel" button
        - Closes the Modal but the backdrop remains

    - Adding multiple movie items into the list in the DOM
        - Click a movie item (anywhere in the list) to delete
            - Followed by clicking the "No (Cancel)" button multiple times
            
        - Click a different movie item to delete
            - Then click the "Yes" button

        - Returns the following error on the brower's JavaScript console
            
            "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property "remove" of undefined at deleteMovieHandler"

        - Then deletes the entire items from the list

        - NOTE: Issue occurs when deleting multiple items from the list
            - Deleting the ONLY one (1) movie item does NOT cause a problems
            
        - Culprit
            - Whenever the Arrow function "startDeleteMovieHandler()" executes
                - Respective Event listeners are attached to the modal's buttons (i.e. No (Cancel) & Yes)

            - When the button "No (Cancel)" is clicked
                - The modal is closed
                - The attached Event listeners for both buttons remains

            - When the Arrow function "startDeleteMovieHandler()" is called again
                - To delete a different (or the same) movie item
                - A new set of Event listeners are crated w/ the previous ones as well
                - Causing confusion as the previous Event listeners will be executed

            - The same modal is ALWAYS been re-used w/ the same button for every movie item

        - Solution
            - Clear the existing Event listeners 
        
    - Finishing touch
        - Render the HTML element <section> w/ an "id" of "entry-text"
            - When the list in the DOM is empty
            - Call the Arrow function "updateUI()" whenever a movie item is deleted


- On the practice project (assets/scripts/app.js)
    - On the Arrow function "backdropClickHandler()"
        - Call the Arrow function "clearMovieInput()"

    - On the Arrow function "cancelMovieHandler()"
        - After the call to Arrow function "closeMovieModal()"
        - Call the Arrow function "toggleBackdrop()"
    
    - On the Arrow function "deleteMovieHandler()"
        - At the last line, call the Arrwo function "closeMovieDeletionModal()"

    - On the Arrow function "startDeleteMovieHandler()"
        - BEFORE adding an Event listener to the Element node "cancelDeletionButton"
            - Remove previous ones using the method ".removeEventListener()"
            - Pass the same argument values
                - 1st = "click"
                - 2nd = "closeMovieDeletionModal"

        - After the declaration of the Arrow function in the local constant "confirmDeletionButton"
            - Use the method ".replaceWith()" on the Element node "confirmDeletionButton"
                - Pass "confirmDeletionButton.cloneNode(true)" as argument
                - Creates a clone after the declaration
                - Effectively removes previous Event listner 

            - Change the constant (i.e. const) of "confirmDeletionButton" to a variable (i.e. let)

            - Use the method ".querySelector()" on the clone Element node "confirmDeletionButton"
                - To re-attach the HTML element to the Element node

    - On the Arrow function "deleteMovieHandler()"
        - Call the Arrow function "updateUI()" at the last line

    - Save the changes

    - Load / reload the browser
        - Test if the preivous bugs are still presents

        - If the modal w/ the test "Your personal movie database" is rendered
            - When the list of movies is empty
