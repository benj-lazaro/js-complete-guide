What Are Iterables And Array-like Objects
-----------------------------------------
- An Iterable is:
    - Basically an object where you can use the for-of loop

    - It is also an object that implement the "iterable" protocol
        - It have an @@iterator method (i.e. symbol.iterator)
        - Reference (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Iteration_protocols)
        - Reference (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Iterator/@@iterator)

    - NOT every iterable is an array

    - Other iterables: NodeList, String, Map, Set


- An Array-like object is:
    - An object that have a "length" property
        - It uses indexes to access items

    - An array-like object is NOT THE SAME as an iterable
    
    - NOT every array-like object is an array

    - Other array-like objects: NodeList, String
