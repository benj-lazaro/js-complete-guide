Retrieving Indexes With indexOf() and lastIndexOf()
--------------------------------------------------
- The indexOf() is a method of the Array instance
    - Returns the first (instance) index at which a given element can be found
    - Returns -1 if NOT found
    - Reference (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/indexOf)

    Syntax:

    indexOf(searchElement)
    indexOf(searchElement, fromIndex)


- The lastIndexOf() is a method of the Array instance
    - Returns the last (instance) index at which a given element can be found
    - Returns -1 if NOT found
    - The array is searched backwards, starting at fromIndex (argument value)
    - Reference (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/lastIndexOf)

    Syntax:

    lastIndexOf(searchElement)
    lastIndexOf(searchElement, fromIndex)


- NOTE: Both methods works fine with primitive values but NOT on reference values
    - Passing a reference value as argument returns a -1 (element NOT found)

    - A JavaScript object is a reference value

    - The address of the object stored as an element in an array is different
        - From the address of the object passed as an argument value to either methods
        - Thus always return a -1 (NOT found) result
