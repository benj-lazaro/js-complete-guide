The Spread Operator
-------------------
- The ... allows an iterable (array or string) to be expanded
    - Where 0 or more arguments (for function calls) or elements are expected

    - In an object literal
        - Enumerates the properties of an object
        - Adds the key-value pairs to the object being created

    - It looks exactly like the rest syntax BUT performs the opposite
        - The ... expands an array into elements

    - Use case
        - Perform a shallow copy of an existing array

    - Reference (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_syntax)

    - NOTE: A common misconception of using the ... operator
        - It is ASSUMED that the shallow copy array
            - Is populated with elements that are shallow copied as well

        - In reality, these elements are the same ones in the original array
        - Updating an element in the original array is reflected on the shallow copied array

        - To create a shallow copy of the array and its elements
            - Use the .map() method instead
            - Prevents changes in the elements to be reflected to the new array


Syntax:

myFunction(a, ...iterableObj, b)
[1, ...iterableObj, '4', 'five', 6]
{ ...obj, key: 'value' }
