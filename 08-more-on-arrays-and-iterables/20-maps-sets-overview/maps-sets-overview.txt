Maps & Sets: Overview
---------------------
- Arrays store (nested) data of any kind and length
    - Iterable; may special array methods are available

    - Order is guaranteed
        - Duplicates are allowed
        - Zero-baed index to access elements


- Sets store (nested) data of any kind and length
    - Iterable; some special set methods are available

    - Order is NOT guaranteed
        - Duplicates are NOT allowed
        - NO index-based access to elements

    - Reference (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Set)


- Maps store key-value pairs of any king and length, any key values are allowed
    - Iterable, some special map methods are available

    - Order is guaranteed
        - Duplicate keys are NOT allowed
            - But values can be duplicated 
            
        - Key-based access to elements

    - Can use any values (and types) as keys

    - Better performance for large quantities of data

    - Better performance when adding & removing date frequently

    - Reference (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map)


- Objects can use string, numbers or symbols as keys

    - Perfect for small to medium-sized sets of data
    
    - Easier / quicker to create (typically with better performance)
