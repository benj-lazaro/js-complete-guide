Maps VS Objects
---------------
- Maps
    - Can use ANY values and types as keys
    - Offer better performance for large quantities of (key-value) data
    - Offer better performance when adding + removing data frequently (multiple times per second)
    - Takes a bit longer when creating new maps


- Objects
    - ONLY may use strings, numbers or symbols as keys
    - Perfect for small / medium-sized sets of data
    - Easier / quicker to create (typically also with better performance)


- NOTE: 98% of cases, you'll work with arrays and objects
    - Maps and Sets have their niche use cases
        - Maps for large quantities of fast changing data
            - Attach additional information that will NOT be merged into the object & bloat it

        - Sets for unique data
