Understanding WeakSet
---------------------
- WeakSet is a collection of garbage-collectable values   
    - A value in the WeakSet may ONLY occur ONCE

    - It ONLY stores objects and symbols (garbage collectables)

    - It has a limited amount of methods compared to a Set
        - It does NOT have .entries() method 
        - Content of a WeakSet can be viewed using console.log()

    - NOTE: A garbage collection is controlled by the browser; NOT by the user
        - Assigning a "null" value to an object in order to be garbage collected
            - The object may remain present when performing a console.log() on the WeakSet
            - The browser have marked the object for garbage collection at its own leisure

    - Common use case
        - An application that stores data in a set or arrays
            - Where eventually will let go of the data at some point
            - Needed to be sure that the data can be garbage collected
            - Clears the object from heap memory

            - NOTE: On a normal Set, despite clearning the data
                - The reference to the data will remain
                - It will NOT be cleared from memory
                - That is until .delete() method is used
