Understanding WeakMap
---------------------
- WeakMap is a collection of key-value pairs whose keys MUST be object or non-registered symbols
    - With values of any artibrary JavaScript data type
        - Which does NOT create strong reference to its keys

    - The object as a key does NOT prevent it from being garbage collected
        - Once an object used as a key has been collected
            - The corresponding value become a candidate for garbage collection
            - As long as it is NOT strongly referred to elsewhere in the code

    - To remove data from a WeakSet
        - Assign the object key with the value of "null"
        - The object will be marked by the browser for garbage collection
