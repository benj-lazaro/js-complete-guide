What Are "Iterables" & "Array-like Objects"
-------------------------------------------
- An Iterable
    - Technically is an object that implements the "iterable" protocol

    - It has an @@iterator method w/
        - A Symbol.iterator property  

        - A Symbol is a special data-type in JavaScript that
            - Will be explored in detail later

    - It is simply an object where
        - It can be loop through a "for..of" loop

    - NOT every Iterable is an Array
        - e.g. NodeList, String, Map, Set


- An Array-like object
    - Technically is an object that
        - Has a property ".length"
        - Uses an index to access items
        
    - NOTE: It is NOT the same as an Iterable

    - NOT every Array-like object is an Array
        - e.g. NodeList & String


- A real array has a couple of behaviors & bunch of methods that
    - Does NOT exists on an Array-like object & Iterable
