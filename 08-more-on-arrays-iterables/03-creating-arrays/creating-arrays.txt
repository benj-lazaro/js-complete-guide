Creating Arrays
---------------
- Using the bracket notation
    - The MOST common way of creating an array

    Syntax:
    const <name> = [<item_1>, ... <item_n> ];


- Using the Array constructor
    - Using the optional keyword "new"
        - Followed by the constructor function "Array()"
        - Pass array item(s) as arguments

    Syntax:
    const <name> = [new] Array(<item_1>, ... <item_n>);

    - IMPORTANT: Passing a single number as argument value
        - The number is interpreted as the length of the array to be created
        - Creates an empty array of pre-determined length

    - NOTE: This is slower from a performance perspective
        - Better use the bracket notation


- Using the global Array object w/ the method ".of()"
    - Chain the method ".of()" to the object Array
        - Pass an item(s) as argument
        - Creates a non-empty array of pre-determined length

    Syntax:
    const <name> = [new] Array.of(<item_1>, ... <item_n>);

    - NOTE: This is slower from a performance perspective
        - Better use the bracket notation

    
- Using the global Array object w/ the method ".from()"
    - Chain the method ".from()" to the object Array
        - Pass an iterable as argument
        - Creates an array whose items are taken from an iterable

    Syntax:
    const <name> = [new] Array(<iterable>);

    - NOTE: This is slower from a performance perspective
        - Better use the bracket notation
