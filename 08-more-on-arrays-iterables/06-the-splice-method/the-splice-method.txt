The ".splice()" Method
----------------------
- The array method ".splice()"
    - Changes the content of an array by
        - Adding new element(s) in-place
        - Removing or replacing existing element(s)

    - Returns removed element(s) from the array

    - It accepts two arguments
        - Start index
        - Number of elements to delete starting from the start index

        - NOTE: Passing a 0 on the 2nd argument
            - NO element(s) will be deleted from the array

    - It accepts an optional arguments
        - Element(s) to be added into the array
        - Starting from the specified start index

    - Reference (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/splice)


    Syntax:
    <array>.splice(<start_index>, <delete_count>);
    <array>.splice(<start_index>, <delete_count>, [<element_1>, ...]);
    <array>.splice(<start_index>);
    

- Passing the <start_index> argument ONLY
    - Interpreted as the start index value
    - Deletes ALL elements from the start index value until the end of the array


- Passing a negative number as the <start_index> argument value
    - Interpreted as the index count STARTS at the end of the array
    
    - NOTE: Using a negative index value to access an element
        - Does NOT work on a normal array operation
        - ONLY works w/ the ".splice()" method


- The ".splice()" method is AVAILABLE ONLY on REAL ARRAYS
    - Both array-like object & iterable are NOT INCLUDED

    - Use the "Array" object's method ".from()"
        - To convert an array-like object & iterable into a REAL ARRAY
        - In order to use the method ".splice()"
        

- On the practice project (app.js)
    - Insert a new element as the 1st of the pre-defined array "hobbies"
        - Using the method ".splice()"
        
        - Pass the arguments
            - 1st: 0            = start index
            - 2nd: 0            = NO deletion
            - 3rd: "Good Food"  = new element to insert

    - Insert two (2) new elements at the 2nd index position
        - Using the method ".splice()"
        
        - Pass the arguments
            - 1st: 1            = start index
            - 2nd: 0            = NO deletion
            - 3rd: "Good Food", "Coding"  = new elements to insert

    - Delete the element located at index 1
        - Using the method ".splice()"
        
        - Pass the arguments
            - 1st: 1            = start index
            - 2nd: 1            = delete one (1) element located at start index

    
    - Delete the 2nd element to the last element
        - Using the method ".splice()"
        
        - Pass the arguments
            - 1st: -2           = start index
            - 2nd: 1            = delete one (1) element located at start index

        - Store the removed element
            - In a global constant named "removedElement"

    
    - Delete ALL elements from the array
        - Using the method ".splice()"
        
        - Pass the arguments
            - 1st: 0            = start index

        - Store the removed elements
            - In a global constant named "removedElements"
