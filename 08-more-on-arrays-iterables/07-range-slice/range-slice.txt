Selecting Ranges & Creating Copies With ".slice()"
--------------------------------------------------
- The array method ".slice()"
    - Returns a brand-new array based on the entire or portion of an existing array

    - This brand-new array is a "shallow copy" of the original array
        - It has a different reference in memory than the original array

        - Any changes in the original array 
            - It is NOT reflected on the "shallow copy" & vice-versa

    - This method accepts two (2) arguments
        - 1st: start index
        - 2nd: end index (NOT included in the shallow copy)

    - Calling the method w/ one (1) arguments
        - Returns a "shallow copy" from the specified start index up to the array's end

    - Calling the method w/ NO arguments
        - Returns a "shallow copy" of the entire original array

    - Calling the method w/ negative index values
        - BOTH start & end index values MUST be negative values

    - Reference (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/slice)

    Syntax:
    <original_array>.slice();
    <original_array>.slice(<start_index>, <end_index>);


- On the practice project (app.js)
    - Insert a new element as the 1st of the pre-defined array "testResults"

    - Create a brand-new "shallow copy" of the array "testResults"
        - Store in on a global constant named "storedResults"

    - Test the "shallow copy"
        - Insert a new element into the original array "testResults"
            - Using the method ".push()"
            - Pass "5.91" as argument values

        - The array "storedResults" should be unchanged


    - Create a "shallow copy" array that 
        - Contains the 1st two (2) elements of the original array "testResults"
        - Store the returned array in a global constant named "portionResults"

    - Create a "shallow copy" array that
        - Contains the last two (2) element of the original array "testResults"
        - Store the returned array in a global constant named "lastResults"

    - Create a "shallow copy" array that
        - Constains the 3rd element (index position 2) up to the end of the original array
        - Store the returned array in a global constant named "thirdToEndResult"

    - Save the changes
