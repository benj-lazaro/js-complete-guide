Finding Stuff With ".find()" & ".findIndex()"
---------------------------------------------
- The array method ".find()"
    - Works with both primitive & reference elements w/in an array

    - Returns the 1st matching element that satisfies
        - The callback function passed as an argument value

    - The passed callback function can accept up to three (3) arguments
        - 1st   = singular name of the object element w/in an array
        - 2nd   = index of the object element
        - 3rd   = plural name of elements stored w/in the

    - The callback function
        - Performs a comparison operation to find a match
        - Stops the operation when a match is found
        - Returns the matching element

    - NOTE: This method works w/ the same reference address of the object element
        - Any changes made on the object element will IMMEDIATELY be reflected

    - Reference (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/find)


    Syntax:
    <array>.find(<callback_function>(<element>, [<index_of_element>, <array_name>]));


- The array method ".findIndex()"
    - Returns the index of the 1st matching element that satisfies
        - The callback function passed as an argument value

    - Returns "-1" if NO match is found

    - The passed callback function can accept up to three (3) arguments
        - 1st   = singular name of the object element w/in an array
        - 2nd   = index of the object element
        - 3rd   = plural name of elements stored w/in the

    - The callback function
        - Performs a comparison operation to find a match
        - Stops the operation when a match is found
        - Returns the matching element

    - Reference (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/findIndex)


    Syntax:
    <array>.findIndex(<callback_function>(<element>, [<index_of_element>, <array_name>])));


- On the practice project (app.js)
    - Create a new array w/ reference values
        - Store in a global constant named "personData"

    - To search for a matching object element w/in the array
        - Use the method ".find()"

        - Pass an Array function as argument value w/ the following parameters
            - 1st   = "person" (singular name of the object element)
            - 2nd   = "index" 
            - 3rd   = "persons" (plural name of the object elements)

        - Inside the Arrow function
            - Use a "return" statement on a comparison operation

            - To search through the element object's ".name" property that
                - Matches the value "Manuel"
        
        - Store the returned object in a global constant named "findPerson"


    - To search for the index of a matching object element w/in the array
        - Use the method ".findIndex()"

        - Pass an Array function as argument value w/ the following parameters
            - 1st   = "person" (singular name of the object element)
            - 2nd   = "index" 
            - 3rd   = "persons" (plural name of the object elements)

        - Inside the Arrow function
            - Use a "return" statement on a comparison operation

            - To search through the element object's ".name" property that
                - Matches the value "Manuel"
        
        - Store the returned index value in a global constant named "findPersonIndex"
