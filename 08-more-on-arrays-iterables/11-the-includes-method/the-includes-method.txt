Is It included?
---------------
- The array method ".includes()"
    - Determines whether an array includes a certain value among its elements

    - Accepts a primitive value (to search for) as argument value
        - Optionally, accept the index value from where to start the search

    - Returns boolean value "true" if there is an element
        - Otherwise, returns "false" & the value of "-1"
        
    - NOTE: Functions similarly to the method ".indexOf()"

    - Use case:
        - To check for the existence of a specific primitive value in an array
            - NOT interested in the element's index or the element itself
    
    - Reference (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/includes)


    Syntax:
    <array>.includes(<search_element>);
    <array>.includes(<search_element> [,<start_index>]);
