Alternative To "for..of" Loops: The ".forEach()" Method
-------------------------------------------------------
- The array method ".forEach()"
    - Alternative to the "for..of" loop
        - Offers the advantage of having access to an element's index

    - Accepts a function as argument

    - The function can accept up to three (3) arguments
        - 1st   = singular name of the object element w/in the array
        - 2nd   = index of the object element
        - 3rd   = plural name of elements stored w/in the array

    - Reference (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/forEach)


    Syntax:
    <array>.forEach(<callback_function>(<object_element>, <index>, <array_name>));


- For the practice project (app.js)
    - Create a new array w/ priimitive values
        - Stored in a global constant named "prices"

    - Create a constant named "tax"
        - Store the value of "0.19"

    - Create a constant named "taxAdjustedPrices"
        - Store the value of an empty array

    - On the array "prices"
        - Chain the method ".forEach()"

        - Pass an Array function as argument value w/ the following parameters
            - 1st   = "price" (singular name of the object element)
            - 2nd   = "index" 
            - 3rd   = "prices" (plural name of the object elements)

    - Inside the Arrow function
        - On the array "taxAdjustedPrices"
            - Chain the method ".push()"

        - Pass the following expression as argument value

            price * (1 + tax)
