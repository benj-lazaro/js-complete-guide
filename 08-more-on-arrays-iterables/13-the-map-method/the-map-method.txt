Transforming Data With ".map()"
-------------------------------
- The array method ".map()"
    - Creates a brand-new array that is populated w/ the results
        - Returned from the function that is passed as argument value

    - The function can accept up to three (3) arguments
        - 1st   = singular name of the object element w/in the array
        - 2nd   = index of the object element
        - 3rd   = plural name of elements stored w/in the array

    - The function is responsible for
        - Returning a new element for every element read from the original array

    - It is the easier & shorter alternative to the method ".forEach()"
        - Removes the need to manage a separate array where
            - The new elements are pushed using the method ".push()"

    - Reference (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map)


- On the practice project (app.js)
    - Create a new array w/ priimitive values
        - Stored in a global constant named "prices"

    - Create a constant named "tax"
        - Store the value of "0.19"

    - On the array "prices"
        - Chain the method ".map()"

        - Pass an Array function as argument value w/ the following parameters
            - 1st   = "price" (singular name of the object element)
            - 2nd   = "index" 
            - 3rd   = "prices" (plural name of the object elements)

    - Inside the Arrow function
        - Create an object named "priceObj" w/ the following properties
            - "index"   = assign the value of parameter "index"
            - "taxAdjPrice" = assign the expression "price * (1 + tax)"

        - Use a "return" statement
            - To return the object "priceObj"

    - Store the new array on a global constant named "taxAdjustedPrices"
