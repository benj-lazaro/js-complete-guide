".sort()"ing And ".reverse()"ing
--------------------------------
- The array method ".sort()"
    - Sort elements of an array "in-place" (i.e. no copy is made)

    - By default, converts elements into of string data type
        - Sort element by comparing their UTF-8 code values

        - Sorts in ascending order (default)
            - ONLY the 1st character of a string is compared

   - To sort elements that are numbers
        - Pass a function as argument value

        - The function accepts two (2) arguments
            - e.g. "a", "b"

        - Uses an "if" statement to compare elements by pairs
            - If the value of "a" is GREATER THAN "b"
                - Return a 1

            - If the value of "a" & "b" are equal
                - Return a 0

            - If the value of "a" is LESS THAN "b"
                - Return a -1

        Example:
        function compareFn(a, b) {
            if (a is less than b by some ordering criterion) {
                return -1;
            } else if (a is greater than b by the ordering criterion) {
                return 1;
            }
            // a must be equal to b
            return 0;
        }

    Syntax:
    <array>.sort();
    <array>.sort(<callback_function>);


- The array method ".reverse()"
    - Rerverses the elements of an array "in-place" (i.e. no copy is made)

    - Reference (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/reverse)


    Syntax:
    <array>.reverse();


- On the practice project (app.js)
    - Create a new array w/ priimitive values
        - Stored in a global constant named "prices"

    - Use the array method ".sort()" on the array "prices"
        - Pass an Arrow function w/ two (2) parameters "a" & "b" as argument value

    - Inside the Arrow function
        - Use an "if" statement to compare the values of "a" & "b"

        - If the value of "a" is greater than "b"
            - Return the value of 1

        - If the value of "a" & "b" are equal
            - Return the value of 0

        - Otherwise, the value of "a" is less than "b"
            - Return the value of -1

        - Sorts the elements of the array "prices" in-place

        - Save the same reference address of the array "prices"
            - To the global constant named "sortedPrices"

    - On the array "sortedPrices"
        - Use the method ".reverse()"
            - To reverse the elements in place
