Filtering Arrays With ".filter()"
---------------------------------
- The array method ".filter()"
    - Reduces the amount of elements of an array
        - Returns a "shallow-copy" of the original array w/ filtered elements

    - Accepts a function as argument
        - The function implements the filtering on each element of the original array

        - The Arrow function can accept up to three (3) arguments
            - 1st   = singular name of the object element w/in an array
            - 2nd   = index of the object element
            - 3rd   = plural name of elements stored w/in the array

        - If the condition evaluates to a boolean "true"
            - Add the element to the new array
            - Otherwise, drop the element

    - Returns the brand-new "shallow-copy" array
        - The elements of the original array remains UNTOUCHED

    Syntax:
    const <new_array> = <array>.filter(<function>);


- On the practice project (app.js)
    - Create a new array w/ priimitive values
        - Stored in a global constant named "prices"
    
    - Use the method ".filter()" on the array "prices"
        - Pass an Arrow function as argument

    - The Arrow function can accept up to three (3) arguments
        - 1st   = "price"
        - 2nd   = "index"
        - 3rd   = "prices"

    - Inside the function
        - Declare a "return" statement that
            - Returns the value if the value in "price" is greater than 6

    - Store the returned brand-new array w/ filtered elements
        - In a global constant named "filteredPrices"
