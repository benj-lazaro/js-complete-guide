Where Arrow Functions Shine
---------------------------
- Passing an Arrow function as argument to an array method
    - Helps make the code concise


- When working a/ an Arrow function that contains a single-line expression 
    - Drop the pair of "( )" that holds the parameter variables

    - Drop any unused parameter variables
        - Keep the ones that is/are used by the single-line expression

    - Drop the pair of "{ }" that contains the body

    - Drop the "return" statement
        - The result is implicitly returned from the Arrow function
    
    - Drop the single-line expression's ";"


- On the practice project (app.js)
    - Refactor the Arrow function that has a single-line expression
        - Passed as argument to the array method ".filter()"
