The Important ".reduce()" Method
--------------------------------
- The array method ".reduce()"
    - Reduces the elements of an array into a simplier value 
        - simplier value = single number or string
        - e.g. sum of all elements

    - It accepts two (2) argument
        - 1st   = function
        - 2nd   = starting or initial value (optional)

    - The passed function can take up to four (4) arguments
        - 1st   = previousValue
        - 2nd   = currentValue
        - 3rd   = currentIndex (optional)
        - 4th   = plural name of the elements w/in an array (optional)

    - The function executes the logic on every element of the array that
        - Reduces into a simplier value
    
        - Explicitly returns the simplier (reduced) value
            - Using the "return" statment
        
        - NOTE: Elements of the array remains untouched

    - During the 1st execution of the function
        - The parameter "previousValue" is assigned w/ the starting initial value
            - If defined, otherwise it is "undefined"

        - The parameter "currentValue" is assigned w/ the 1st element of the array

    - On the succeeding executions
        - The result of the operation is assigned to the parameter "previousValue"

        - The current element is assigned to the parameter "currentValue"

    
    - Reference (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/Reduce)


    Syntax:
    const <variable> = <array>.reduce(<function>(<prevValue>, <curValue>), <start_value>);


- On the practice project (app.js)
    - Create a new array w/ priimitive values
        - Stored in a global constant named "prices"

    - Use the method ".filter()" on the array "prices"
        - Store the reduced value to a global constant named "sum"

        - Pass an Arrow function as the 1st argument

        - Pass the value 0 as the 2nd argument
            - Initial value that the function will work on

    - On the Arrow function
        - Define the parameters "prevValue" & "curValue"

    - Inside the Arrow function
        - Use a "return" statement on the expression

            prevValue + curValue
    
    - Save the changes

    - Load / reload the browser
        - Launch the browser's JavaScript console
        - View the results

    - Implement a shortened version of the Arrow function
        - Since it contains a single-line expression
