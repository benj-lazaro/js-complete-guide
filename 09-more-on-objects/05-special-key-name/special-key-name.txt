Special Key Name & Sqaure Bracket Property Access
-------------------------------------------------
- Any name that can be used as a variable name
    - Can be used as a key name for an object's property 
        - However, NOT every property key name can be used as a variable name
    
    - Any property key name is AUTOMATICALLY COERCED to a string data type
        - Technically an object is a dictionary of keys which are of string data type
    
        - Values assigned to an object's property keys can be of ANY data type / value
    
    - Key name with a:
        - Dash in-between words
        - Whitespace in-between words
        - Multiple words with either dash or whitespace in-between
    
        - Can be allowed by wrapping the key name within the pair of " " 
    

- To access the value from key enclosed with a pair of " "
    - Call the object name
    - Followed by the "." notation
    - Then a square bracket notation [ ]
    - Pass the key name as a string enclosed with a pair of " "

        <object_name>.["<key_name>"];

    - This can also be used when accessing and/or manipulating properties of queried DOM elements
