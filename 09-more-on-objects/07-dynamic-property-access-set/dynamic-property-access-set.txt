    - Offers access to value of a property name that could NOT access using dot notation

    - Offers a way to dynamically access properties' values
        - Without hard coding the property name in-between the pair of [ ]
            - The property name could be stored in a constant or variable
                - Stored in anything that yields a value (e.g. expression, function, etc.)

            - Pass the name of the constant / variable as argument value to [ ]

            - NOTE: constant / variable name MUST NOT be enclosed in " "

        - The value of the property name can be taken from a user input
