Demo App & Shorthand Property Syntax
------------------------------------
- The demo app requires a user to:
    - Enter the title of a favorite movie

    - Offers a form to provide extra information about the movie
        - Where in the user can set the name of the property & its corresponding value

    - Clicking "Add Movie" button
        - The movie and corresponding extra information will be added
        - Displayed in the list, located just underneath the form

    - Offers a search bar
        - Where a movie is searched


- Shorthand property name notation
    - If the property name has the same as the value name (storing the actual value)
        - You can omit the ":" and value name all together
        - Leaving the property name by its own
