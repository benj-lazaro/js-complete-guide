Render Elements Based On Objects
--------------------------------
- Render individual movie object as an <li> child element within the <ul> parent element
    - The parent <ul> element is currently hidden through the CSS display property set to "none"


- The code implementation for the renderMovie() function is NOT ideal
    - It clear the entire <li> child elements
    - Re-renders every objects in the list whenever a new movie object is added
        - Costing performance issues in the long run

    - This was done intentionally to focus solely on rendering objects as elements
    
    - Ideally, each new movie object added and rendered
        - It should NOT clear the entire <li> child elements 
        - It should NOT require re-rendering everything from scratch
