Adding The Filter Functionality
-------------------------------
- Implement the code for the search logic (Filter by Title)
    - Search keyword(s) through each movie object's title property

    - Create an event handler named searchMovieHandler()
        - Fetches value of <input> element with an ID attribute of "filter-title"
        - Calls renderMovies() and pass the fetched value as argument
        - Renders the corresponding movie object as an child <li> element if it exists

    - Addn an event listener for "click" event
        - To the <button> with an ID attribute of "search-btn"
        - Hook-up the event handler searchMovieHandler()

    - Refactor renderMovies()
        - Implement the ability to accept an argument
            - Add an argument variable named filter 
            - With the default value of " "

        - Implement a ternary expression assign to a constant named filteredMovies
            - If the expression is falsy
                - Returns the entire movie array to the constant filteredMovies

            - Otherwise, calls the .filter() method on the movies array
                - Passes an arrow function to .filter() as an argument value

                - The arrow function accepts a movie object as argument value

                - Using the .includes() method, each movie.info.title is checked
                    - If the value of the filter exists, it is returned to filteredMovies

    - NOTE: Search (Filter by Title) is case-sensitive
