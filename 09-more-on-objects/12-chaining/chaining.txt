Understanding Chaining (Property & Method Chaining)
---------------------------------------------------
- Chaining is attaching multiple methods in a single line expression
    - Using "." to link up methods / properties of an object

    - In order to perform multiple operations
        - On objects / values returned by a prior operation

        - e.g. Math.random().toString() // Chaining Math.random() & .toString() methods
    
    - It address the hassle of splitting lines of code unnecessarily 
        - Across multiple lines with helper variables in-between
