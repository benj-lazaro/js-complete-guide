The Object Spread Operator
--------------------------
- The spread operator "..." allows an iterable (array or string) to be expanded
    - In places where zero or more arguments (functions calls) or elements (array) are expected

    - In an object literal, it enumerates the properties of an object
        - When adds / merges these properties into a new object being created

        - The new object is NOT a shallow-copy of the original object
            - Additional / removal of a property is NOT reflected back to the original object

    - It looks like the rest operator but performs the opposite
        - The rest operator collectes multiple elements & then condenses them into a single element
        - The spread operator expands an iterable into individual elements

    - NOTE: The spread operator does NOT perform a deep dive copy of the original object
        - The object itself is NOT shallow-copied
        - Any iterable value assigned to a property of the object remains to be a reference value
        - An update to this value will be reflected on both the original and new object

        - To prevent this, the iterable values MUST be copied manually

Syntax:

myFunction(a, ...iterableObj, b)
[1, ...iterableObj, '4', 'five', 6]
{ ...obj, key: 'value' }
