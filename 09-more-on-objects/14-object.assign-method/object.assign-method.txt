Understanding Object.assign()
-----------------------------
- The Object.assign() is a static method
    - It copies all enumerable own properties
    - From one or more source objects to a target object
    - Returns the modified target object

    - It is similar to the spread operator "..." when copying an object
        - It has been around longer 
        - It offers better browser support

        - NOTE: Using the spread ... operator is a lot better & shorter
        - Consider using this method ONLY to ensure better browser support

    - Common use case
        - Assign properties of an existing object to a new object

    - Reference (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/assign)


Syntax:

Object.assign(target)
Object.assign(target, source1)
Object.assign(target, source1, source2)
Object.assign(target, source1, source2, /* â€¦, */ sourceN)
