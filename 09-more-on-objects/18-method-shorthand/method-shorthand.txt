The Method Shorthand Syntax
---------------------------
- A shorthand when adding / defining a method inside an object
    - Remove the "function" keyword
    - Remove the ":" after the property name of the method
    
    From:

    <property_name>: function () {
        // Body of method
    }

    To:

    <property_name>() {
        // Body of method
    }


- When using an arrow function (instead of a normal method declaration)
    - Remove the "=>"
    - Remove the ":" after the property name of the method


    From:

    <property_name>: () => {
        // Body of method
    }

    To:

    <property_name>() {
        // Body of method
    }


- NOTE: This is the shorthand for methods that will be used moving forward in this course
