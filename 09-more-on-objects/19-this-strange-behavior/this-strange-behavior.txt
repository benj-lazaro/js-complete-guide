The this Keyword And Its Strange Behavior
-----------------------------------------
- If calling a method without properly associating an object

    - When a function is invoked as a method of an object
        - "this" points to that object

    - When a function is invoked as a standalone function
        - i.e. with no object name declared prior to the method

        - In non-strict mode (default)
            - "this" refers to the global Window object

        - In strict mode
            - "this" returns an undefined value


- To address this issue
    - Declare the object name prior to calling the method

    - If that is NOT an option,
        - Use the .bind() method
        - To pre-configure what "this" will refer to
