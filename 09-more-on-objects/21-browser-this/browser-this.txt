What The Browser (Sometimes) Does To this
-----------------------------------------
- Using "this" in an event listener, 
    - Results to a different behavior
    - It is assumed that the value of "this" inside an event handler
        - Refers to the global Window object which is NOT entirely wrong
    
    - Behind the scenes, the browser triggers the event (e.g. click)
        - The browser binds "this" to the DOM element that triggered the event

        - However, this is ONLY if an arrow function is NOT USED to define the event handler
            - Otherwise, "this" will refer to the global Window object
