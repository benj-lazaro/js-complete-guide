Getting Started With OOP Code
-----------------------------
- Build a simple frontend web app
    - Render a list of products
    - Add product to a shopping cart 

    - Using object literal notation
        - Demonstrates how hard to write proper OOP code 
        - How difficult to write reusable object code

        - Require manual insertion of a product into the product list
            - Check property name is NOT mistyped or forgotten

    - A better implementation would be
        - A blueprint for the product object

        - Write a function / method that creates a product object
            - Pass certain amount of argument values 
            - Generates said product object

        - Create non-object components
            - Regular objects that holds some data (a class)
