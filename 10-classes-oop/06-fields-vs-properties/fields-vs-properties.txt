Fields VS Properties
--------------------
- A class field located within a class 
    - It defines a property of an object when it is created from this class
    - This is public (by default) in terms of visibility


- A class property is located within a class' constructor method
    - It initialize a class field with an argument value
    - This is public (by default) in terms of visibility


- The class constructor itself is public (by default) in terms of visibility
    - It overwrites initial values (if any) assigned to the class fields

    - It is possible to define class fields within the constructor method
        - Particularly if these fields will hold an initial value after instantiation

        - Class fields that will NOT be initialized with a value upon instantiation
            - Can be left in the class declaration (outside the constructor method)

    - It is also possible add new class fields within the constructor
        - Without defining one in the class declaration
