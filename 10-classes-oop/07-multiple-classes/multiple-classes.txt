Using & Connecting With Multiple Classes
----------------------------------------
- In addition to using class to create objects that contain data
    - It can also create objects that hold logic 

    - NOTE: The order of the class (in the code) does NOT matter
        - JavaScript parses the entire code prior execution

        - All classes HAVE to be defined before calling them
