Binding Class Methods & Working With this
-----------------------------------------
- Implement code for the generated DOM element "Add to Cart" button

- Note: class methods working with "this"
    - Use .bind() and pass "this" as an arguement

    - Implemented using calling a class' method as a callback function to an event listener
        - Without the use of .bind(this)

        - The value of "this" refers to the global Window object
            - Will return an "undefined" value
