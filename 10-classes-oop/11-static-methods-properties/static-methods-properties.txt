Static Methods & Properties
---------------------------
- A static field, property or method is defined with the "static" keyword

    - Static properties can NOT be directly accessed on instances of the class
        - They are ONLY accessinle on the class itself
        
        - Useful for caches, fixed configuration or any other data
            - Other data that you do NOT need to be REPLICATED ACCROSS instances

        - Typically used in helper classes, global configuration etc.


    - Static methods are often utility functions
        - Functions to create or clone objects

    - Reference (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes/static)


- An instance field, property or method is defined WITHOUT the "static" keyword
    - They are ONLY accessible on instances based on a class

    - They are used for core, re-usable logic

    - NOTE: Earlier OOP lectures have been based on instance fields, properties & methods


- NOTE: Using "this" will refer to the class
    - NOT to the object instantiate from said class
