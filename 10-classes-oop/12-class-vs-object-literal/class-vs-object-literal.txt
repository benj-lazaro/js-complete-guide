First Summary: Classes VS Object Literals
-----------------------------------------
- When using the keyword "new" when instantiating an object from a class
    - It is equivalent to declaring an object literal

    - Object literal notation
        - It is great for general data grouping

        - Objects which it is created ONLY once
            - And will NOT be reused
        
        - It quick & easy to create 
            - NO overhead


- When to use classes
    - It is great for re-creating the same type of object, over and over again

    - Initially presents an overhead
        - But offers easy "object duplication" thereafter
