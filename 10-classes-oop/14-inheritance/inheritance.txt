Introducting Inheritance
------------------------
- In the demo app, the classes ProductItem, ProductList, ShoppingCart & Shop
    - Have a render() method that creates an element
    - Although each does differently but it ALWAYS create an element


- The concept of inheritance is basically sharing code among classes
    - Instead of creating multiple classes
        - Each contains duplicated properties and/or methods
        - Resulting to sub-optiomal code due to code duplication

    - Using inheritance, write a base class
        - Which contains commonly used properties and/or methods among classes
    
    - The base class is then EXTENDED in order to create a specialized class
        - Which inherits the commonly used properties and/or methods
        - Then add extra properties and/or methods that is/are specific to its own
