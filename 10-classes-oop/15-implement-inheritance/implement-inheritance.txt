Implementing Inheritance
------------------------
- Implement the concept of inheritance on the project app


- In JavaScript, it is NOT possible to inherit from multiple classes
    - It can ONLY extend (inherit) from one class


- Class constructor rules
    - If a sub-class (e.g. ShoppingCart) does NOT have a constructor
        - The constructor of the parent class (e.g. Component) constructor is automatically called
        - Otherwise, it will call its own constructor

    - If a sub-class has its own constructor & needed to call the parent class' constructor
        - Use the special keyword "super"
        - Execute it like a function e.g. super()

    - When adding "super" to a sub-class constructor
        - Make user you are NOT relying on any fields in that super constructor

        - When adding properties to the sub-class constructor
            - It MUST be done ONLY AFTER calling super()
